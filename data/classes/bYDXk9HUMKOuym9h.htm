------ Description (en) ------
<p><em>You command powerful magic, not through study or devotion to any ideal, but as a vessel or agent for a mysterious, otherworldly patron that even you don't entirely understand. This entity might be a covert divinity, a powerful fey, a manifestation of natural energies, an ancient spirit, or any other mighty supernatural being-but its nature is likely as much a mystery to you as it is to anyone else. Through a special familiar, your patron grants you versatile spells and powerful hexes to use as you see fit, though you're never certain if these gifts will end up serving your patron's larger plan.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Ability: INTELLIGENCE</strong></p>
<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>
<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>
<h1 class="title">Roleplaying the Witch</h1>
<h2 class="title">During Combat Encounters...</h2>
<p>You cast spells to change the course of battle. You use magical hexes to hamper enemies and aid allies, while leveraging more powerful spells to control the battlefield, heal, or harm, aided by your extraordinary familiar, brewed potions, and magical items.</p>
<h2 class="title">During Social Encounters...</h2>
<p>You provide knowledge on numerous topics, including a variety of magical matters, and you might call upon your patron's magic to charm or deceive others.</p>
<h2 class="title">While Exploring...</h2>
<p>You remain alert for magical traps and treasures, employing a clever array of spells to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. Your familiar might aid you through its own considerable set of exceptional abilities.</p>
<h2 class="title">In Downtime...</h2>
<p>You brew potions, craft other magical items, or hunt for new spells for your familiar to learn. You might try to learn more about your patron, their aims, or your own powers, and you might seek out the company of other witches for collaboration or community.</p>
<h2 class="title">You Might...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Strive to learn more about your patron or familiar, your patron's goals, why they chose to empower you, and how you fit into their plans.</li>
<li>Seek out new sources of magic, like scrolls and spellbooks, to supplement the spells your patron provides.</li>
<li>View your familiar as a steadfast ally, a dear friend, or a necessary nuisance, depending on its personality.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="title">Others Probably...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wonder about the nature of your patron and the source of your magic, worrying you'll turn on them or that you unknowingly serve to a foul power.</li>
<li>Appreciate your ability to aid them with magic, whether you do so by helping them directly or by hampering their adversaries.</li>
<li>Take care not to offend you, fearful that you'll place a malicious hex on them if you're angered.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="title">Ancestry and Background</h2>
<p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>
<h2 class="title">Initial Proficiencies</h2>
<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>
<h2 class="title">Patron</h2>
<p>You weren't born with the power to cast spells, nor have you spent years in devotion to tomes, deities, or mystical secrets. Your power comes through a potent being that has chosen you as their vessel to carry forth some agenda in the world. This entity is typically mysterious and distant, revealing little of their identity and motivations, and they grant you spells and other magical powers through a familiar, which serves as a conduit for their power.</p>
<p>A patron might be a deity or demigod, a coven of powerful hags, a fey lord, an archdevil, or a similarly powerful entity, or perhaps multiple such figures working in tandem. As you gain more of your patron's power, you might learn more about who or what they are-certain combinations of themes and lessons suggest particular patrons or agendas-but patrons empower witches for their own secretive reasons, which they rarely reveal in full.</p>
<p>At 1st level, choose your patron's theme, which determines your spellcasting tradition, a skill, a special cantrip you gain, and a spell added to your familiar.</p>
<h2 class="title">Familiar</h2>
<p>Your patron has sent you a familiar, a mystical creature that teaches you and facilitates your spells. This familiar follows the basic rules for familiars, though as it's a direct conduit between you and your patron, it's more powerful than other familiars. Your familiar gains an extra familiar ability, and gains another extra ability at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.</p>
<p>Your familiar is the source and repository of the spells your patron has bestowed upon you, and you must commune with your familiar to prepare your spells each day using your witch spellcasting (see below). Your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-level spells, and one additional spell determined by your patron's theme. You choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to.</p>
<p>Each time you gain a level, your patron teaches your familiar two new spells of any level you can cast, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells.</p>
<p>Your familiar can learn new spells independently of your patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically consuming a scroll of that spell in a process that takes 1 hour. You can use the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Q5iIYCFdqJFM31GW]{Learn a Spell} exploration activity to prepare a special written version of a spell, which your familiar can consume as if it were a scroll. You and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another witch's familiar. Both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your spellcasting tradition's spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an offering to the other familiar's patron. You can't prepare spells from another witch's familiar.</p>
<p>If your familiar dies, your patron replaces it during your next daily preparations. The new familiar might be a duplicate or reincarnation of your former familiar or a new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your former familiar knew regardless. Your familiar's death doesn't affect any spells you have already prepared.</p>
<h2 class="title">Witch Spellcasting</h2>
<p>Using your familiar as a conduit, your patron provides you the power to cast spells. You can cast spells using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell} activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells.</p>
<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells your familiar knows. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>
<p>As you increase in level as a witch, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, as shown in Table 2-7: Witch Spells per Day.</p>
<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<h3 class="title"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>
<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>
<h3 class="title"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>
<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a witch. For example, as a 1st-level witch, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level witch, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>

<h2 class="title">Hexes</h2>
<p>Your patron and familiar teach you special spells called hexes. A hex is a short-term effect drawn directly from your patron's magic. As such, you can cast only one hex each turn; attempts to cast a second hex spell on that turn fail and the spellcasting actions are lost.</p>
<p>Hexes are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Refocus} activity to commune with your familiar.</p>
<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>
<p>You learn the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.rMOI8JFJ0nT2mrCF]{Phase Familiar}</em> hex, which you can cast as a reaction to protect your familiar from harm. You learn most other hexes from witch lessons.</p>
<p><strong>Hex Cantrips</strong></p>
<p>Hex cantrips are special hexes that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like, though you can still cast only one hex each round. Hex cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose with your witch spellcasting and aren't counted toward your prepared cantrips. Your hex cantrips are determined by your patron theme.</p>
<h2 class="title">Skill Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 2</span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>
<h2 class="title">Witch Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 2</span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a witch class feat.</p>
<h2 class="title">General Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>
<h2 class="title">Skill Increases<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>
<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>
<h2 class="title">Ability Boosts<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>
<h2 class="title">Ancestry Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
<h2 class="title">Magical Fortitude<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Expert Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 7</span></h2>
<p>Your inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for your witch spellcasting increase to expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Lightning Reflexes<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast, helping you to avoid danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Alertness<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Weapon Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>Through sheer experience, you've improved your technique with your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Defensive Robes<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>The flow of magic through your spellcasting and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Weapon Specialization<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>You can inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary.</p>
<h2 class="title">Master Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 15</span></h2>
<p>You've achieved mastery over your patron's magic. Your proficiency ranks for spell attacks and spell DCs for your witch spellcasting increase to master.</p>
<h2 class="title">Resolve<span style="float: right;">Level 17</span></h2>
<p>Communion with your familiar has steeled your mental fortitude. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>
<h2 class="title">Legendary Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 19</span></h2>
<p>You've perfected your command of the magic your patron provides. Your proficiency ranks for spell attacks and spell DCs for your witch spellcasting increase to legendary.</p>
<h2 class="title">Patron's Gift<span style="float: right;">Level 19</span></h2>
<p>Your patron grants you the power to command incredible works of magic. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using witch spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, these spell slots can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.SelPslNtTfzxp7fs]{Patron's Truth} feat to gain a second slot.</p>
<h2 class="title">Patron Themes</h2>
<p>Each patron has a theme, regardless of their nature or identity. This theme describes the forces over which the patron grants a witch influence. Some patrons are multifaceted, granting different themes and teaching different lessons to different witches. Your patron's theme determines the following.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spell List</strong> You use this magical tradition and spell list.</li>
<li><strong>Patron Skill</strong> You become trained in the listed skill.</li>
<li><strong>Hex Cantrip</strong> You gain this special hex cantrip.</li>
<li><strong>Granted Spell</strong> Your familiar automatically learns the spell listed here, in addition to those you gain through witch spellcasting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.VVMMJdIWL7fAsQf3]{Baba Yaga Patron}</strong></p>
<p>Baba Yaga teaches you how to transfer spirits into objects and freeze your foes. A witch with Baba Yaga as their patron can choose an inanimate object as a familiar. If they do, they still can gain master abilities and some familiar abilities that don't require movement. The object familiar has no Speeds and must select a Speed familiar ability before it can move, coming to life in a way appropriate to the chosen Speed and using the statistics of a normal familiar for that day.</p>

------ Description (fr) ------
<p><em>Vous possédez de puissants pouvoirs magiques. Ce n’est ni grâce à vos études ou à votre dévotion à un idéal, mais parce que vous êtes un agent ou un réceptacle au service d’un patron mystérieux venant d’ailleurs que même vous ne comprenez pas entièrement. Il pourrait s’agir d’une divinité incognito, d'une fée puissante, d'une manifestation d’énergie naturelle, d'un esprit ancien ou de n’importe quelle autre entité surnaturelle puissante… mais sa nature est sans doute autant un mystère pour vous que pour tous les autres. Grâce à un familier très particulier, votre patron vous octroie des sorts diversifiés et des maléfices puissants que vous pouvez utiliser à votre guise, sans jamais vraiment être certain que cela contribuera ou non aux objectifs plus larges de votre patron.</em></p>
<p><strong>Caractéristique essentielle : INTELLIGENCE</strong><br />Au niveau 1, votre classe vous accorde une prime de Caractéristique à l'Intelligence.<br /><br /><strong>Points de vie: 6 plus votre modificateur de Constitution</strong><br />Vous augmentez votre maximum de PV de ce montant au niveau 1, puis à chaque fois que vous gagnez un niveau.<br /></span></p>
<h1>Jouer une Sorcière</h1>
<h2>Lors des rencontres de combat...</h2>
<p>Vous lancez des sorts pour modifier le cours des combats. Vous utilisez des maléfices magiques pour affaiblir les ennemis et venir en aide à vos alliés, tout en lançant des sorts plus puissants pour contrôler le champs de bataille, pour soigner ou pour blesser. Vous vous appuyez aussi sur l’aide de votre familier, des potions que vous créez et de divers objets magiques.</p>
<h2>Lors des rencontres sociales...</h2>
<p>Vous faites part de vos connaissances sur de nombreux domaines, y compris divers sujets magiques et vous pourriez utiliser la magie de votre patron pour charmer ou pour tromper.</p>
<h2>En Exploration...</h2>
<p>Vous restez attentif à la présence de pièges ou de trésors magiques en employant un arsenal de sorts judicieusement choisi pour surmonter les obstacles qui se dressent sur votre route. Votre familier pourrait vous aider grâce à son impressionnante panoplie de capacités extraordinaires.</p>
<h2>Pendant un intermède...</h2>
<p>Vous créez des potions, fabriquez d’autres objets magiques ou partez à la recherche de nouveaux sorts que votre familier pourra apprendre. Vous pourriez tenter d’en apprendre plus au sujet de votre patron, de ses objectifs ou de vos propres pouvoirs, et vous pourriez rechercher la compagnie d’autres sorcières en vue de collaborer ou de simplement vous rassembler.</p>
<h2>Vous...</h2>
<ul>
<li>pourriez vous efforcer d’en apprendre plus à propos de votre patron ou de votre familier, des objectifs de votre patron, de la raison pour laquelle il vous a choisie et du rôle que vous jouez dans ses plans ;</li>
<li>pourriez rechercher de nouvelles sources de magie comme des parchemins ou des grimoires pour rejoindre les sorts que votre patron vous fournit ;</li>
<li>pourriez considérer votre familier comme un allié loyal, un ami cher ou une créature nuisible mais indispensable, en fonction de sa personnalité.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Les autres...</h2>
<ul>
<li>se posent des questions sur la nature de votre patron et de la source de votre magie, peuvent s’inquièter de savoir s’il va se retourner contre eux ou du fait que vous serviez sans le savoir une puissance maléfique ;</li>
<li>apprécient votre capacité à leur venir en aide grâce à votre magie, que vous le fassiez en les aidant directement ou en affaiblissant vos ennemis ;</li>
<li>prennent bien soin de ne pas vous offenser, de peur que vous ne leur lanciez un maléfice s’ils vous mettent en colère.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ascendance et historique</h2>
<p>En plus des capacités que votre classe vous accorde au niveau 1, vous bénéficiez des avantages de votre ascendance et de votre historique.</p>
<h2>Maîtrises initiales</h2>
<p>Au niveau 1, vous obtenez un nombre de maîtrises qui représentent votre entraînement de base. Elles sont indiquées au début de cette classe.</p>
<h2>Patron</h2>
<p>Vous n’êtes pas née avec la capacité de lancer des sorts et vous n’avez pas non plus dévoué plusieurs années à étudier des tomes ni à approfondir votre dévotion envers des dieux ou des secrets mystiques. Vos pouvoirs proviennent d’une puissante entité qui vous a choisie comme réceptacle pour faire avancer ses objectifs dans le monde. Cette entité est généralement mystérieuse et distante et ne révèle que peu de choses à propos de son identité et de ses motivations. Elle vous octroie des sorts et d’autres pouvoirs magiques grâce à un familier qui sert d’intermédiaire à son pouvoir.</p>
<p>Un patron pourrait être une divinité ou un demi-dieu, un conclave de puissantes guenaudes, un Seigneur-fée, un archidiable ou une autre entité de même niveau de puissance, voire même plusieurs entités similaires œuvrant de concert. En acquérant de plus en plus de pouvoirs de la part de votre patron, vous pourriez en apprendre plus sur leur identité (certaines combinaisons de thèmes et de leçons suggèrent des patrons ou des objectifs spécifiques) mais les patrons accordent leurs pouvoirs à des sorcières pour des raisons secrètes qu’ils ne révèlent que très rarement en totalité.</p>
<p>Au niveau 1, choisissez le thème de votre patron, qui détermine votre tradition de lanceur de sorts, vous accorde une compétence, un tour de magie spécifique que vous obtenez et un sort qui est ajouté à votre familier.</p>
<h2>Familier</h2>
<p>Votre patron vous a envoyé un familier, une créature mystique qui vous instruit en tant que sorcière et vous permet d’utiliser des sorts. Ce familier suit les règles du Livre de base mais, comme il s’agit d’un lien direct entre vous et votre patron, il est plus puissant que les autres familiers. Votre familier gagne une aptitude de familier supplémentaire et d’autres aptitudes de familier supplémentaires aux niveaux 6, 12 et 18.</p>
<p>Votre familier est la source et le dépositaire des sorts que votre patron vous a octroyés et vous devez communier avec votre familier pour préparer vos sorts de sorcière chaque jour. Votre familier commence en connaissant 10 tours de magie, 5 sorts de niveau 1 et un sort de plus déterminé par votre patron. Vous choisissez ces sorts dans la liste des sorts courants de la tradition déterminée par votre patron ou parmi les autres sorts de cette tradition auxquels vous avez accès.</p>
<p>Chaque fois que vous gagnez un niveau, votre patron enseigne à votre familier deux nouveaux sorts de n’importe quel niveau que vous pouvez lancer, choisis parmi les sorts courants de votre tradition ou ceux auxquels vous avez accès. Des dons peuvent également donner à votre familier des sorts supplémentaires.</p>
<p>Votre familier peut apprendre des nouveaux sorts indépendamment de votre patron. Il peut apprendre n’importe quel sort se trouvant sur la liste de votre tradition en consommant physiquement un parchemin contenant ce sort au cours d’un processus qui lui prend 1 heure. Vous pouvez utiliser l’activité d’exploration  @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Q5iIYCFdqJFM31GW]{Apprendre un sort} pour préparer une version écrite spéciale d’un sort que votre familier peut ensuite consommer comme s’il s’agissait d’un parchemin. Vous et votre familier pouvez utiliser l’activité Apprendre un sort pour enseigner à votre familier un sort provenant du familier d’une autre sorcière. Les deux familiers doivent être présents pendant la totalité de l’activité, le sort doit se trouver sur la liste de votre tradition et vous devez payer le coût usuel pour cette activité, généralement sous la forme d’offrandes au patron de l’autre familier. Vous ne pouvez pas préparer de sorts provenant du familier d’une autre sorcière.</p>
<p>Si votre familier meurt, votre patron le remplace lors de vos prochains préparatifs quotidiens. Le nouveau familier pourrait être un duplicata ou une réincarnation de votre ancien familier ou une toute nouvelle créature mais dans tous les cas, il connaît les mêmes sorts que votre familier précédent. La mort de votre familier n’affecte pas les sorts que vous avez déjà préparés.</p>
<h2>Incantation de sorcière</h2>
<p>En utilisant votre familier comme intermédiaire, votre patron vous accorde le pouvoir de lancer des sorts. Vous pouvez lancer des sorts en utilisant l’activité @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Lancer un sort} et vous pouvez fournir des composantes matérielles, somatiques et verbales lors de l’incantation.</p>
<p>Au niveau 1, vous pouvez préparer jusqu’à deux sorts de niveau 1 et cinq tours de magie chaque matin à partir des sorts que votre familier connaît. Les sorts préparés restent disponibles jusqu’à ce que vous les lanciez ou jusqu’à ce que vous prépariez vos sorts à nouveau. Le nombre de sorts que vous pouvez préparer correspond à ce qu’on appelle vos emplacements de sorts.</p>
<p>Au fur et à mesure que vous gagnez des niveaux de sorcière, le nombre d’emplacements de sorts dont vous disposez augmente, comme indiqué sur la table suivante.</p>
<p>Certains sorts exigent un jet d’attaque de sort pour déterminer leur efficacité ou obligent vos ennemis à faire un jet contre leur DD (en général un jet de sauvegarde). Comme l’Intelligence est votre caractéristique essentielle, vos jets d’attaque de sort et le DD de vos sorts utilisent votre modificateur d'Intelligence.</p>
<h3><strong>Les sorts intensifiés</strong></h3>
<p>Quand vous obtenez des emplacements de sort de niveau 2 et supérieurs, vous pouvez les remplir avec des versions plus puissantes de sorts d’un niveau inférieur. Cela augmente le niveau du sort, l’intensifiant pour qu’il corresponde à l’emplacement de sort. Nombre de sorts possèdent des améliorations spécifiques quand ils sont intensifiés à un niveau donné.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Les tours de magie</strong></h3>
<p>Un tour de magie est un type de sort qui n’utilise pas d’emplacement de sort. Il se lance à volonté chaque jour, aussi souvent que vous le désirez. Un tour de magie est toujours automatiquement intensifié jusqu’à la moitié de votre niveau arrondi à l’entier supérieur, donc généralement égal au sort de plus haut niveau que vous pouvez lancer en tant que Sorcière. Par exemple, les tours de magie d’une Sorcière de niveau 1 sont de niveau 1, tandis que ceux d’une Sorcière de niveau 5 sont de niveau 3.</p>

<h2>Maléfices</h2>
<p>Votre patron et votre familier vous enseignent des sorts spéciaux appelés maléfices. Un maléfice est un effet à court terme qui provient directement de la magie de votre patron. En tant que tel, vous ne pouvez lancer qu’un seul maléfice par tour ; si vous tentez de lancer un second maléfice ce tour-là, la tentative échoue et les actions d’incantation sont perdues.</p>
<p>Les maléfices sont un type particulier de sorts focalisés. Lancer un sort focalisé coûte 1 Point de Focalisation et vous commencez votre carrière avec une réserve de focalisation de 1 Point de Focalisation. Vous remplissez votre réserve de focalisation au cours de vos préparatifs quotidiens et vous pouvez regagner 1 Point de Focalisation en passant 10 minutes à utiliser l’activité de @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Refocalisation} pour communier avec votre familier.</p>
<p>Les sorts focalisés sont automatiquement intensifiés jusqu’à la moitié de votre niveau arrondi au niveau supérieur. Ils n’utilisent pas d’emplacement de sorts et vous ne pouvez pas les lancer en utilisant un emplacement de sorts. Certains dons vous donnent plus de sorts focalisés et augmentent la taille de votre réserve de focalisation mais votre réserve de focalisation ne peut jamais dépasser 3 Points de focalisation.</p>
<p>Vous apprenez le maléfice @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.rMOI8JFJ0nT2mrCF]{Déphasage de familier} que vous pouvez lancer en une réaction pour protéger votre familier contre ce qui pourrait lui causer du tort. À part cela, c’est surtout via les @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.SOan0fqyFTrkqJLV]{Leçons de sorcière} que vous apprenez d'autres maléfices.</p>
<p><strong>Tours de magie de maléfices</strong></p>
<p>Les maléfices qui sont également des tours de magie sont des maléfices spéciaux qui ne coûtent pas de Point de Focalisation, de sorte que vous pouvez les lancer à volonté, mais pour lesquels la limite d’un maléfice par round s’applique toujours. Les maléfices qui sont également des tours de magie s’ajoutent aux tours de magie que vous choisissez mais ne sont pas pris en compte dans le nombre maximal de tours de magie que vous pouvez préparer. Vos tours de magie de maléfices sont déterminés par votre Thème de patron.</p>
<h2>Dons de compétence<span style="float: right;">Niveau 2</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 2, puis tous les deux niveaux, vous gagnez un don de compétence. Ces dons disposent du trait compétence. Pour choisir un don de compétence, vous devez être au moins qualifié dans la compétence correspondante.</p>

<p>À partir du niveau 7, vous pouvez utiliser l’amélioration de compétence pour devenir maître dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes déjà expert et à partir du niveau 15, vous pouvez l’utiliser pour devenir légendaire dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes déjà maître.</p>
<h2>Primes de caractéristiques<span style="float: right;">Niveau 5</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 5, puis tous les cinq niveaux, vous améliorez quatre caractéristiques différentes. Vous pouvez utiliser ces primes de caractéristique pour faire passer une valeur de caractéristique au-dessus de 18. La prime augmente la valeur de caractéristique de 1 si elle est déjà de 18 ou plus ou de 2 si elle est inférieure à 18.</p>
<h2>Dons ancestraux<span style="float: right;">Niveau 5</span></h2>
<p>Vous gagnez un don ancestral au niveau 5 puis tous les quatre niveaux, en plus de celui avec lequel vous avez commencé.
<h2>Vigueur magique<span style="float: right;">Niveau 5</span></h2>
<p>La puissance de votre patron augmente votre résilience physique. Votre rang de maîtrise pour les jets de Vigueur passe à expert.</p>
<h2>Incantateur expert<span style="float: right;">Niveau 7</span></h2>
<p>Vous avez appris à mieux contrôler le pouvoir que votre patron vous a accordé. Vos rangs de maîtrise pour les jets d’attaque de sort et le DD des sorts de sorcière passent à expert.</p>
<h2>Réflexes fulgurants<span style="float: right;">Niveau 9</span></h2>
