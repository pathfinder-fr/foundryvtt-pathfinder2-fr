<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>
<p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>
<h2>Eidolon</h2>
<p>You have a connection with a powerful and usually otherworldly entity called an eidolon, and you can use your life force as a conduit to manifest this ephemeral entity into the mortal world. Magic also flows through this conduit from your eidolon into you, so your eidolon determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose from (as described in Summoner Spellcasting on page 54).</p>
<p>Choose a type of eidolon from the options starting on page 59 and other eidolons you have access to. When you choose your eidolon, you also determine its appearance and general form, within the parameters for that particular type of eidolon. Once you establish your eidolon's type and general appearance, these features can't be changed later, except by selecting special evolution feats that can cause your eidolon to develop new features.</p>
<p>Your magical connection with your eidolon takes the form of a sigil on each of your bodies. As long as your eidolon is manifested, the sigil glows with light and can't be covered or disguised via any means; it will shine through clothing, appear over cloaks, and remain unaffected by obfuscating magic. This, combined with the way that the two of you clearly act in tandem, makes it readily apparent to an intelligent observer that the two of you are connected in some way, even if the person has never encountered a summoner before.</p>
<p>You bring your eidolon into reality with the Manifest Eidolon action.</p>
<p>Your eidolon is no mere minion. It doesn't have the minion or summoned trait, and the two of you work together and coordinate your actions. You and your eidolon share your actions and multiple attack penalty. Each round, you can use any of your actions (including reactions and free actions) for yourself or your eidolon.</p>
<p>You coordinate your actions with your eidolon more efficiently when you Act Together. Your connection with your eidolon allows you to communicate with it telepathically at all times, even when it isn't manifested. You also gain the Share Senses action.</p>
<p>Lastly, the connection between you and your eidolon means you both share a single pool of Hit Points. Damage taken by either you or the eidolon reduces your Hit Points, while healing either of you recovers your Hit Points. Like with your actions, if you and your eidolon are both subject to the same effect that affects your Hit Points, you apply those effects only once (applying the greater effect, if applicable). For instance, if you and your eidolon get caught in an area effect that would heal or damage you both, only the greater amount of healing or damage applies.</p>
<h3>Gear and your Eidolon</h3>
<p>Your eidolon can't wear or use magic items, except for items with the eidolon trait. An eidolon can have up to two items invested. Your eidolon's link to you means it can benefit from certain magic items invested by you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your eidolon gains item bonuses to Perception and skills from any magical items that you have invested.</li>
<li>Your eidolon increases its item bonus to AC based on your armor's armor potency rune or bracers of armor. It also gains an item bonus to its saves from the resilient rune on your armor or from your bracers of armor. Other permanent items that grant or increase item bonuses to AC and saves might convey a similar benefit, as determined by the GM.</li>
<li>Your eidolon's Strikes benefit from the fundamental and property runes on your handwraps of mighty blows. Alternatively, you can Invest a magic weapon (even though magic weapons can't normally be Invested) to share its fundamental and property runes with your eidolon. You share these benefits only while you're holding the weapon, and you can have no more than one weapon invested in this way at a time. In either case, the eidolon gains only the benefits that can apply to its attacks, with the same limitations noted in handwraps of mighty blows.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lost and Altered Actions</h3>
<p>If you or your eidolon becomes slowed, stunned, quickened, or otherwise affected by something that changes the actions you gain at the start of each turn, it affects your shared actions. However, if you are both subject to such an effect, apply only the more severe one. For instance, if you or your eidolon were @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}, you would start your turn with one fewer action, but if you were both slowed 1, you would still lose only one action, rather than adding the two slowed effects together. However, if you were slowed 1 and your eidolon @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 2}, you'd have two fewer actions, because that's the more severe effect. If only one of you becomes restricted in how you can spend your actions, that restriction doesn't automatically extend to the other; for example, if your eidolon became @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} or petrified, it wouldn't be able to move, but you could still use your actions to move. The GM resolves any situation that's unclear.</p>
<p>You, as the player, control both your summoner and your eidolon, and the two are generally considered to cooperate unless you decide for them not to. While a summoner's link with an eidolon is a partnership, ultimately the eidolon is linked to you, not the other way around. If there's ever a conflict of who should act, you win out over your eidolon. This means that if the eidolon comes under an effect that would take its actions out of your control, such as the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.yblD8fOR1J8rDwEQ]{Confused} or controlled condition, you can use all of your shared actions so your eidolon doesn't have any actions remaining to cause trouble (as long as you are able to act). However, if you came under such an effect, you would simply use all of your shared actions, preventing your eidolon from acting.</p>
<h2>Summoner Spellcasting</h2>
<p>Your link to your eidolon grants you limited magic connected to your eidolon's nature. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because of the magic you draw from your eidolon, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need a material component pouch.</p>
<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell and five cantrips. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>
<p>As you increase in level as a summoner, the magical link with your eidolon grants you additional, more powerful spell slots. Your total number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast are shown in Table 2-4: Summoner Spells per Day. Because of the way you draw magic from your connection to your eidolon, you begin to lose lower-level spell slots once you reach 5th level. The maximum number of spell slots you get from the summoner class is four, starting when you reach 4th level.</p>
<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 447 of the Core Rulebook.</p>
<h3>Heightening Spells</h3>
<p>When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>
<h3>Cantrips</h3>
<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a summoner. For example, as a 1st-level summoner, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level summoner, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>
<h3>Spell Repertoire</h3>
<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your eidolon, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it doesn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>
<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2-4: Summoner Spells per Day), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell. At 3rd level, you add the first 2nd-level spell to your repertoire. At 4th level you gain your second and your spell repertoire reaches its maximum size of five spells.</p>
<p>At 5th level, in addition to adding two 3rd-level spells to your repertoire, you lose your lowest level of spell slots. Any time you lose a level of spell slots, you lose two spells in your repertoire as well. These can come from spells you already know or out of the number of new spells you're learning. On levels in which you don't change your spell slots, you can swap out multiple spells, as described below.</p>
<h3>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</h3>
<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. If it's a level at which you lose a set of lower-level slots, you can replace the two in either order. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>
<p>At 6th level and every even level thereafter, you can swap out any number of your spells for different spells of a level you can cast. When you do, you must keep at least one spell you can cast with your lowest level of spell slots so you don't end up with slots you can't use. For instance, at 6th level you would need to keep at least one 2nd-level spell, but all your other spells could be 3rd level.</p>

<h2>Link Spells</h2>
<p>Your connection to your eidolon allows you to cast link spells, special spells that have been forged through your shared connection with your eidolon. Link spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to specifically connect with your eidolon, such as by having a heart-to-heart conversation, playing together, or meditating in unison on the nature of your bond.</p>
<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear on page 300 of the Core Rulebook.</p>
<p>You learn the evolution surge link spell, which allows you to grant your eidolon one of several useful benefits.</p>
<h3>Link Cantrips</h3>
<p>Link cantrips are special link spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like. Link cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from your tradition's spell list. Generally, only feats can give you more link cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out link cantrips gained from summoner feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining (Core Rulebook page 481).</p>
<p>You learn the boost eidolon link cantrip, which briefly improves your eidolon's capabilities, allowing it to attack with greater power.</p>
<h2>Evolution Feat</h2>
<p>Evolution feats are a special type of summoner class feat that allow you to customize your eidolon through your shared link. You gain an evolution feat for your eidolon at 1st level, representing the differences that make it unique from other eidolons of its type. If you retrain this feat, the feat you replace it with must also be an evolution feat.</p>
<h2>Skill Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 2</span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>

<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a summoner class feat.</p>
<h2>General Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>
<h2>Shared Vigilance<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>You and your eidolon work together to remain alert to threats around you, allowing you to perceive far more together than you could individually. Your proficiency rank in Perception and your eidolon's proficiency rank in Perception increase to expert.</p>
<h2>Skill Increases<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>
<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>
<h2>Unlimited Signature Spells<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>All of your spells are signature spells. That means that if you know a spell, you can heighten it freely by casting it from a higher-level spell slot, up to the maximum level of spell you can cast. You can similarly cast any of its lower-level versions without learning them separately.</p>
<h2>Ability Boosts<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, boost four different ability scores. You can use these boosts to increase ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>
<p>Your eidolon also gets four ability boosts at these levels. The eidolon's ability boosts follow the same rules as yours.</p>
<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
<h2>Eidolon Unarmed Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>

<h2>Eidolon Weapon Specialization<span style="float: right;">Level 7</span></h2>
<p>Your eidolon has learned how to inflict greater injuries with its unarmed attacks. It deals 2 additional damage with unarmed attacks in which it's an expert. This damage increases to 3 if it's a master, and 4 if it's legendary.</p>
<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>As your connection to your eidolon deepens, the power of your spells increases. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your eidolon's tradition increase to expert.</p>
<h2>Shared Reflexes<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>You and your eidolon boost each other's reflexes, allowing you both to roll away from danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves and your eidolon's proficiency rank for Reflex saves increase to expert.</p>
<h2>Eidolon Defensive Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>Your eidolon increases its ability to avoid attacks. Its proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Simple Weapon Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>Training and magic improved your weapon technique. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Twin Juggernauts<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>

When your eidolon rolls a success on a Fortitude save, it gets a critical success instead.</p>
<h2>Defensive Robes<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>The flow of magic around you increases your ability to avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Eidolon Unarmed Mastery<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>Your eidolon truly masters its unarmed attacks, reaching greater heights. Its proficiency rank for unarmed attacks increases to master.</p>
<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>
<h2>Greater Eidolon Specialization<span style="float: right;">Level 15</span></h2>
<p>Your eidolon's damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with unarmed attacks in which it's an expert, 6 if it's a master, and 8 if it's legendary.</p>
<h2>Shared Resolve<span style="float: right;">Level 15</span></h2>
<p>You and your eidolon steel your mind together against effects that threaten you, each protecting the others' minds from danger. Your and your eidolon's proficiency ranks for Will saves increase to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. When your eidolon rolls a success on a Will save, it gets a critical success instead.</p>
<h2>Eidolon Transcendence<span style="float: right;">Level 17</span></h2>
<p>Your connection with your eidolon approaches its peak, granting your eidolon access to a powerful new ability depending on its type, as described in Eidolon Abilities in each eidolon's entry. This ability also increases one of the eidolon's ability scores by 2.</p>
<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 17</span></h2>
<p>Your connection to your eidolon is strong enough to grant you mastery over associated spells. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your eidolon's tradition increase to master.</p>

Que votre eidolon soit un ami, un serviteur ou même un dieu personnel, le lien que vous entretenez avec lui fait de vous un être extraordinaire, qui façonne le cours de votre vie de manière spectaculaire.</em><br /><br /><strong>Caractéristique essentielle : CHARISME</strong><br />Au niveau 1, votre classe vous donne une prime de caractéristique au Charisme, en fonction de votre choix.<br /><br /><strong>Points de vie : 10 plus votre modificateur de Constitution</strong><br />Vous augmentez votre maximum de PV de ce montant au niveau 1, puis à chaque fois que vous gagnez un niveau.</p>
<h1>Jouer un conjurateur</h1>
<h2>Lors des rencontres de combat...</h2>
<p>Vous et votre eidolon combattez ensemble comme un seul. Vous pouvez compter sur votre eidolon pour les défis quotidiens, conservant vos sorts lorsque vous en avez le plus besoin.</p>
<h2>Lors des rencontres sociales...</h2>
<p>Votre puissante personnalité vous autorise à prendre la direction lorsque vous négociez. Vous et votre eidolon pouvez vous engager avec d'autres de différente manière mais, même si votre gardien reste silencieux, sa présence rappelle à ceux qui vous entourent votre puissance.</p>
<h2>En exploration...</h2>
<p>Que vous restiez en alerte pour trouver la présence de magie étrange ou gardiez un œil pour les problèmes, vous et votre eidolon agissez ensemble pour couvrir plus de terrain, mutualisez vos compétences et comptez sur les capacités de l'autre.</p>
<h2>Pendant un intermède...</h2>
<p>Vous pourriez essayer d'en apprendre plus sur la nature de votre eidolon et plongez plus profondément dans les secrets de sa tradition magique pour apprendre un sort, fabriquer des objets magiques avec l'aide de votre eidolon ou vous faire des alliés en utilisant vos compétences sociales.</p>
<h2>Vous...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comptez sur votre eidolon pour accomplir des tâches physiques lorsque vous vous occupez des tâches mentales.</li>
<li>Développez les attitudes et le maniérisme qui correspondent à la manière de penser de votre eidolon, même morsque votre nature façonne son comportement.</li>
<li>Considérez votre eidolon comme un ami proche, une figure qui vous guide, un protecteur ou un rival qui vous est lié.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Les autres...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Se sentent en sécurité avec vous (et votre eidolon) à leur côté.</li>
<li>Pensent que comme vous connaissez des informations à propos de votre eidolon, vous pourriez connaître des détails à propos d'autres sortes de monstres étranges.</li>

<h2>Ascendance et historique</h2>
<p>En plus des pouvoirs que votre classe vous accorde au niveau 1, vous bénéficiez des avantages de votre ascendance et de votre historique.</p>
<h2>Eidolon</h2>
<p>Vous avez un lien avec une entité puissante provenant généralement d'un autre monde appelée eidolon et vous pouvez utiliser votre force vitale comme un conduit pour manifester cette entité éphémère dans le monde des mortels. La magie passe également par ce conduit, de votre eidolon vers vous et votre eidolon détermine le type de sorts que vous lancez et la liste de sorts que vous choisissez (comme indiqué dans l'Incantation du conjurateur).</p>
<p>Choisissez un type d'eidolon parmi les options de base proposées et les autres eidolons auxquels vous avez accès. Lorsque vous choisissez votre eidolon, vous déterminez également son apparence et sa forme générale, dans le cadre des paramètres de ce type d'eidolon particulier. Une fois que vous avez établi le type et l'apparence générale de votre eidolon, ces caractéristiques ne peuvent plus être modifiées par la suite, sauf en sélectionnant des dons d'évolution spécifiques qui peuvent amener votre eidolon à développer de nouvelles caractéristiques.</p>
<p>Le lien magique que vous nouez avec votre eidolon prend la forme d'un signe cabalistique apparaissant sur chacun de vos corps. Tant que votre eidolon est manifesté, le signe cabalistique émet de la lumière et ne peut être couvert ou déguisé par aucun moyen ; il brillera à travers les vêtements, apparaîtra par-dessus des manteaux et ne sera pas affecté par la magie de dissimulation. Ceci, combiné à la façon dont vous agissez clairement en tandem, rend évident pour un observateur intelligent que vous êtes liés d'une certaine manière, même si cette personne n'a jamais eu l'occasion de rencontrer de conjurateur.</p>
<p>Vous amenez votre eidolon vers la réalité avec l'action Manifester l'eidolon.</p>
<p>Votre eidolon n'est pas un simple sbire. Il ne possède pas le trait sbire ou invoqué et vous travaillez tous les deux ensemble et coordonnez vos actions. Vous et votre eidolon partagez vos actions et votre pénalité d'attaques multiples. Chaque round, vous pouvez utiliser n'importe laquelle de vos actions (y compris les réactions et les actions libres) pour vous-même ou votre eidolon.</p>
<p>Vous coordonnez vos actions avec votre eidolon plus efficacement lorsque vous agissez ensemble. Le lien que vous partagez avec votre eidolon vous permet de communiquer avec lui par télépathie à tout moment, même lorsqu'il n'est pas manifesté. Vous gagnez également l'action Partager les sens.</p>
<p>Enfin, le lien qui existe entre votre eidolon et vous implique que vous partagez tous deux une seul et même réserve de points de vie. Les dégâts subis par votre eidolon ou vous-même réduisent vos points de vie, tandis que la guérison de l'un ou de l'autre permet de récupérer vos points de vie. Comme pour vos actions, si vous et votre eidolon êtes tous deux soumis simultanément au même effet qui affecte vos points de vie, vous n'appliquez ces effets qu'une seule fois (en appliquant le plus important, le cas échéant). Par exemple, si vous et votre eidolon êtes pris dans un effet de zone qui vous soignerait ou vous endommagerait tous les deux, seule la plus grande quantité de soins ou de dégâts s'applique.</p>
<h3>Votre eidolon et l'équipement</h3>
<p>Votre eidolon ne peut pas porter ou utiliser d'objets magiques, à l'exception des objets dotés du trait eidolon. Un eidolon peut avoir jusqu'à deux objets investis. Le lien de votre eidolon avec vous lui permet de bénéficier de certains objets magiques investis par vous.</p>
<ul>
<li>Votre eidolon gagne des bonus d'objets à la Perception et aux compétences de tous les objets magiques que vous avez investis.</li>
<li>Votre eidolon augmente son bonus d'objet à la CA en fonction de la rune de puissance d'armure de votre armure ou des bracelets d'armure que vous portez. Il gagne également un bonus d'objet à ses jets de sauvegardes grâce à la rune de résilience de votre armure ou de vos bracelets d'armure. D'autres objets permanents qui accordent ou augmentent les bonus d'objet à la CA et aux jets de sauvegarde peuvent apporter un avantage similaire, à la discrétion du MJ.</li>
<li>Les Frappes de votre eidolon bénéficient des runes fondamentales et des runes de propriété de vos bandelettes de coups puissants. Vous pouvez également investir une arme magique (même si les armes magiques ne peuvent normalement pas être investies) pour partager ses runes fondamentales et ses runes de propriété avec votre eidolon. Vous partagez ces avantages uniquement lorsque vous maniez l'arme, et vous ne pouvez pas avoir plus d'une arme investie de cette manière à la fois. Dans un cas comme dans l'autre, l'eidolon ne gagne que les avantages qui peuvent s'appliquer à ses attaques, avec les mêmes limitations que celles figurant dans les bandelettes de coups puissants.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions perdues et altérées</h3>
<p>Si vous ou votre eidolon êtes Ralenti, Étourdi, Accéléré ou autrement affecté par quelque chose qui modifie les actions que vous gagnez au début de chaque tour, cela affecte vos actions partagées. Cependant, si vous êtes tous deux soumis à un tel effet, n'appliquez que le plus sévère. Par exemple, si vous ou votre eidolon étiez @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Ralenti 1}, vous commencerez votre tour avec une action de moins, mais si vous étiez tous les deux Ralentis 1, vous ne perdrez qu'une action, au lieu d'additionner les deux effets Ralentis. Cependant, si vous étiez Ralenti 1 et que votre eidolon est @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Ralenti 2}, vous auriez deux actions de moins, car c'est l'effet le plus grave qui s'applique. Si un seul d'entre vous est limité dans la façon dont il peut dépenser ses actions, cette restriction ne s'étend pas automatiquement à l'autre ; par exemple, si votre eidolon devient @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilisé} ou Pétrifié, il ne pourra pas bouger, mais vous pourrez toujours utiliser vos actions pour vous déplacer. Le MJ résout toute situation qui n'est pas claire.</p>
<p>En tant que joueur, vous contrôlez à la fois votre conjurateur et votre eidolon et les deux sont généralement considérés comme coopérant, sauf si vous décidez qu'ils ne le font pas. Si le lien entre un conjurateur et un eidolon est un partenariat, c'est l'eidolon qui est lié à vous et pas l'inverse. S'il y a un conflit pour savoir qui doit agir, vous l'emportez sur votre eidolon. Cela signifie que si l'eidolon subit un effet qui mettrait ses actions hors de votre contrôle, comme l'état @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.yblD8fOR1J8rDwEQ]{Confus} ou Contrôlé, vous pouvez utiliser toutes vos actions partagées afin que votre eidolon n'ait plus d'actions pour causer des problèmes (tant que vous êtes en mesure d'agir). Cependant, si vous étiez soumis à un tel effet, vous utiliseriez simplement toutes vos actions partagées, empêchant votre eidolon d'agir.</p>
<h2>Incantation du conjurateur</h2>
<p>Le lien avec votre eidolon vous confère une magie limitée liée à la nature de votre eidolon. Vous pouvez lancer des sorts en utilisant l'activité Lancer un sort et vous pouvez fournir des composantes matérielles, somatiques et verbales lorsque vous lancez des sorts. En raison de la magie que vous tirez de votre eidolon, vous pouvez généralement remplacer les composantes matérielles par des composantes somatiques, de sorte que vous n'avez pas besoin d'une sacoche de composantes matérielles.</p>
<p>Chaque jour, vous pouvez lancer un sort de niveau 1 et cinq tours de magie. Vous devez connaître les sorts pour les lancer et vous les apprenez via la capacité de classe répertoire de sorts. Le nombre de sorts que vous pouvez lancer chaque jour est appelé vos emplacements de sorts.</p>
<p>À mesure que vous gagnez en niveau en tant que conjurateur, le lien magique avec votre eidolon vous accorde des emplacements de sorts supplémentaires, plus puissants. Votre nombre total d'emplacements de sorts et le niveau le plus élevé des sorts que vous pouvez lancer sont indiqués sur la table des sorts de conjurateur par jour. En raison de la façon dont vous tirez la magie du lien que vous entretenez avec votre eidolon, vous commencez à perdre des emplacements de sorts de niveau inférieur lorsque vous atteignez le niveau 5. Le nombre maximum d'emplacements de sorts que vous obtenez de la classe de conjurateur est de quatre, à partir du niveau 4.</p>
<p>Certains de vos sorts nécessitent que vous fassiez un jet d'attaque de sort pour savoir quel est son efficacité ou que vos adversaires lance un jet contre le DD de vos sorts (typiquement en tentant un jet de sauvegarde).Comme votre caractérstique essentielle est le Charisme, votre jet d'attaque de sorts et votre DD de sort utilisent votre modificateur de Charisme.</p>
<h3><strong>Les sorts intensifiés</strong></h3>
<p>Quand vous obtenez des emplacements de sort de niveau 2 et plus, vous pouvez les remplir avec des versions plus puissantes de sorts de niveau inférieur. Cela augmente le niveau du sort, l’intensifiant pour qu’il corresponde à l’emplacement de sort. Nombre de sorts possèdent des améliorations spécifiques quand ils sont intensifiés à un niveau donné.</p>
<h3><strong>Les tours de magie</strong></h3>
<p>Un tour de magie est un type de sort qui n’utilise pas d’emplacement de sort. Il se lance à volonté chaque jour, aussi souvent que vous le désirez. Un tour de magie est toujours automatiquement intensifié jusqu’à la moitié de votre niveau arrondi à l’entier supérieur, donc généralement égal au sort de plus haut niveau que vous pouvez lancer en tant que conjurateur. Par exemple, les tours de magie d’un conjurateur de niveau 1 sont de niveau 1, tandis que ceux d’un conjurateur de niveau 5 sont de niveau 3.</p>
<h3>Répertoire de sorts</h3>
<p>On appelle répertoire de sorts l’ensemble des sorts que vous savez lancer. Au niveau 1, vous apprenez deux sorts de niveau 1 ainsi que cinq tours de magie de votre choix. Vous les choisissez dans la liste des sorts courants de votre tradition ou parmi les autres sorts de cette tradition auxquels vous avez accès. Vous pouvez lancer un sort de votre répertoire en utilisant un emplacement de sort du niveau correspondant.</p>
<p>Vos emplacements de sorts et les sorts de votre répertoire de sorts sont deux choses séparées. Si un don ou une autre capacité vient ajouter un sort à votre répertoire de sort, cela ne vous donne pas un emplacement de sort supplémentaire et vice versa.</p>
<p>Vous ajoutez des sorts à votre répertoire au fur et à mesure que vous gagnez des niveaux. Chaque fois que vous obtenez un emplacement de sort, vous ajoutez un sort du même niveau dans votre répertoire. Au niveau 2, vous choisissez un autre sort de niveau 1 ; au niveau 3, vous ajoutez votre premier sort de niveau 2 à votre répertoire. Au niveau 4, vous obtenez votre second et votre répertoire de sorts atteint sa taille maximale de cinq sorts.</p>
<p>Au niveau 5, en plus d'ajouter deux sorts de niveau 3 à votre répertoire, vous perdez les emplacements de sorts de votre plus faible niveau de sort. Chaque fois que vous perdez un niveau d'emplacements de sorts, vous perdez également deux sorts de votre répertoire. Cela peut être des sorts que vous connaissiez ou des sorts du nombre de sorts nouveaux que vous apprenez. Aux niveaux auxquels vous ne changez pas d'emplacements de sorts, vous pouvez remplacer plusieurs sorts comme indiqué ci-dessous.</p>
<h3>Remplacer des sorts de votre répertoire</h3>
<p>Lorsque vous obtenez de nouveaux sorts dans votre répertoire, vous pourriez vouloir remplacer une partie des sorts que vous avez appris au préalable. Chaque fois que vous obtenez un niveau et apprenez de nouveaux sorts, vous pouvez remplacer un de vos sorts précédents par un nouveau sort du même niveau. Si vous atteignez un niveau auquel vous perdez un ensemble d'emplacements de niveau inférieur, vous pouvez remplacer les deux dans n'importe quel ordre. Vous pouvez également échanger un tour de magie à la place. Vous pouvez également échanger des sorts à l'aide du réapprentissage durant les intermèdes.</p>
<p>Au niveau 6 puis tous les niveaux pairs par la suite, vous pouvez changer n'importe quel nombre de vos sorts pour des sorts différents d'un niveau que vous pouvez lancer. Lorsque vous le faites, vous devez conserver au moins un sort que vous pouvez lancer avec votre niveau le plus faible de manière à ne pas disposer d'emplacement de sorts que vous ne pourrez pas utiliser. Par exemple, au niveau  6 vous devrez conserver au moins un sort de niveau 2, mais tous les autres sorts peuvent être de niveau 3.</p>

<h2>Sorts liés</h2>
<p>Le lien qui vous unit à votre eidolon vous permet de lancer des sorts liés, des sorts spécifiques qui sont forgés par votre lien partagé avec votre eidolon. Les sorts liés sont un type de sort focalisé. Il faut dépenser 1 point de focalisation pour lancer un sort focalisé et vous commencez avec une réserve de focalisation 1 point. Elle se remplit lors de vos préparatifs quotidiens et vous pouvez récupérer 1 point de focalisation en utilisant l’activité Refocaliser et en consacrant 10 minutes pour vous connecter spécifiquement à votre eidolon, comme en ayant une conversation à cœur ouvert, en jouant ensemble ou en méditant à l'unisson sur la nature de votre lien.</p>
<p>Un sort focalisé est automatiquement intensifié à la moitié de votre niveau, arrondi au supérieur, comme un tour de magie. Un sort focalisé n’a pas besoin d’emplacement de sort et vous ne pouvez pas utiliser un emplacement de sort pour le lancer. Certains dons accordent d’autres sorts focalisés et augmentent la taille de votre réserve de focalisation, bien que cette dernière ne puisse jamais contenir plus de 3 points.</p>
<p>Vous apprenez le sort lié @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.lV8FkHZtzZu7Cy6j]{Flux d'évolution}, qui vous permet de faire bénéficier votre eidolon d'un avantage parmi plusieurs possibles.</p>
<h3>Tours de magie liés</h3>
<p>Les tours de magie liés sont des sorts liés spéciaux qui ne coûtent aucun point de focalisation ; vous pouvez donc les utiliser autant de fois que souhaité. Ces tours de magie s’ajoutent à ceux que vous sélectionnez dans la liste des tours de magie de votre tradition. Généralement, seuls des dons peuvent vous permettre d’apprendre d’autres tours de magie liés. Au contraire des autres tours de magie, vous ne pouvez pas remplacer les tours de magie liés obtenus grâce à un don de conjurateur lorsque vous montez de niveau, à moins que vous ne remplaciez ce don grâce au réapprentissage.</p>
<p>Vous apprenez le tour de magie lié @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.HStu2Yhw3iQER9tY]{Booster l'eidolon}, qui améliore brièvement les capacités de l'eidolon, lui permettant d'attaquer avec une plus grande puissance.</p>
<h2>Don d'évolution</h2>
<p>Les dons d'évolution sont un type spécifique de don de classe de conjurateur qui vous permet de personnaliser votre eidolon à travers votre lien partagé. Vous obtenez un don d'évolution pour votre eidolon au niveau 1, représentant les différences qui le rendent uniques par rapport aux autres eidolons de son type. Si vous utilisez réapprentissage avec ce don, le don par lequel vous le remplacez doit aussi être un don d'évolution.</p>
<h2>Don de conjurateur<span style="float: right;">Niveau 2</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 2 puis tous les niveaux pairs, vous obtenez un don de classe de conjurateur.</p>
<h2>Dons de compétences<span style="float: right;">Niveau 2</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 2, puis tous les deux niveaux, vous gagnez un don de compétence. Ces dons disposent du trait compétence. Pour choisir un don de compétence, vous devez être au moins qualifié dans la compétence correspondante.</p>
<h2>Dons généraux<span style="float: right;">Niveau 3</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 3, puis tous les quatre niveaux, vous gagnez un don général.</p>
<h2>Vigilance partagée<span style="float: right;">Niveau 3</span></h2>
<p>Vous et votre eidolon travaillez ensemble pour rester vigilants sur les dangers qui vous entourent, vous permettant de percevoir bien plus ensemble que ce que vous pourriez voir individuellement. Votre rang de maîtrise en Perception et le rang de maîtrise de votre eidolon en Perception passe à expert.</p>
<h2>Améliorations de compétence<span style="float: right;">Niveau 3</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 3, puis tous les deux niveaux, vous gagnez une amélioration de compétence. Vous pouvez utiliser cette amélioration pour augmenter votre rang de maîtrise et devenir qualifié dans une compétence dans laquelle vous étiez inexpérimenté ou pour améliorer votre rang dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes déjà qualifié pour devenir expert.</p>
<p>À partir du niveau 7, vous pouvez utiliser l’amélioration de compétence pour devenir maître dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes déjà expert et à partir du niveau 15, vous pouvez l’utiliser pour devenir légendaire dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes déjà maître.</p>
<h2>Sorts emblématiques illimités<span style="float: right;">Niveau 3</span></h2>
<p>Tous vos sorts sont des sorts emblématiques. Cela signifie que si vous connaissez un sort, vous pouvez l'intensifier librement en le lançant à partir d'un emplacement de sort de niveau supérieur, jusqu'au maximum du niveau de sort que vous pouvez lancer. Vous pouvez de la même manière lancer tout sort dans une version inférieure sans avoir à les apprendre séparément.</p>
<h2>Primes de caractéristiques<span style="float: right;">Niveau 5</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 5, puis tous les cinq niveaux, vous améliorez quatre caractéristiques différentes. Vous pouvez utiliser ces primes de caractéristiques pour faire passer une valeur de caractéristique au-dessus de 18. La prime augmente la valeur de caractéristique de 1 si elle est déjà de 18 ou plus ou de 2 si elle est inférieure à 18.</p>
<p>Votre eidolon obtient aussi quatre primes de caractéristiques à ces niveaux. Les primes de caractéristiques suivent les mêmes règles que les vôtres.</p>
<h2>Dons ancestraux<span style="float: right;">Niveau 5</span></h2>
<p>Vous gagnez un don ancestral au niveau 5 puis tous les quatre niveaux, en plus de celui avec lequel vous avez commencé.</p>
<h2>Expertise à mains nues de l'eidolon<span style="float: right;">Niveau 5</span></h2>
<p>Votre eidolon devient davantage capable d'utiliser ses attaques à mains nues. Son niveau de maîtrise avec les attaques à mains nues passe à expert.</p>
<h2>Symbiose de l'eidolon<span style="float: right;">Niveau 7</span></h2>
<p>Le lien que vous avez noué avec votre eidolon se renforce, accordant à votre eidolon l'accès à une nouvelle capacité qui dépend de son type, comme indiqué dans les capacités de l'eidolon pour chaque description de chaque type d'eidolon.</p>
<h2>Spécialisation des armes de l'eidolon<span style="float: right;">Level 7</span></h2>
<p>Votre eidolon a appris à infliger des blessures plus importantes avec ses attaques à mains nues. Il inflige 2 dégâts supplémentaires avec les attaques à mains nues dans lesquelles il est expert. Ces dégâts supplémentaires passent à 3 s'il est maître et à 4 s'il est légendaire.</p>
<h2>Incantateur expert<span style="float: right;">Niveau 9</span></h2>
<p>Comme le lien avec votre eidolon s'approfondit, la puissance de vos sorts s'accroit. Votre niveau de maîtrise en attaques de sort et en DD de sort pour les sorts de la tradition de votre eidolon passe à expert.</p>
<h2>Réflexes partagés<span style="float: right;">Niveau 9</span></h2>
