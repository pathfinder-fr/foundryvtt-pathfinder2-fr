Name: Bard
Nom: Barde
État: officielle

------ Description (en) ------
<p><em>You are a master of artistry, a scholar of hidden secrets, and a captivating persuader. Using powerful performances, you influence minds and elevate souls to new levels of heroics. You might use your powers to become a charismatic leader, or perhaps you might instead be a counselor, manipulator, scholar, scoundrel, or virtuoso. While your versatility leads some to consider you a beguiling ne'erdo- well and a jack-of-all-trades, it's dangerous to dismiss you as a master of none.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Ability: CHARISMA</strong></p>
<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Charisma.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>
<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>
<h1>Roleplaying the Bard</h1>
<h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2>
<p>You use magical performances to alter the odds in favor of your allies. You confidently alternate between attacks, healing, and helpful spells as needed.</p>
<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>
<p>You persuade, prevaricate, and threaten with ease.</p>
<h2>While Exploring...</h2>
<p>You're a font of knowledge, folktales, legends, and lore that provide a deeper context and helpful reconnaissance for the group's adventure. Your spells and performances inspire your allies to greater discovery and success.</p>
<h2>In Downtime...</h2>
<p>You can earn money and prestige with your performances, gaining a name for yourself and acquiring patrons. Eventually, tales of your talents and triumphs might attract other bards to study your techniques in a bardic college.</p>
<h2>You Might...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have a passion for your art so strong that you forge a spiritual connection with it.</li>
<li>Take point when tact and nonviolent solutions are required.</li>
<li>Follow your muse, whether it's a mysterious fey creature, a philosophical concept, a psychic force, or a deity of art or music, and with its aid learn secret lore that few others have.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Others Probably...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Relish the opportunity to invite you to social events, either as a performer or a guest, but consider you to be something of a curiosity in their social circles.</li>
<li>Underestimate you compared to other spellcasters, believing you are little more than a foppish minstrel and overlooking the subtle power of your magic.</li>
<li>Respond favorably to your social charm and abilities, but remain suspicious of your beguiling magic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>
<p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>
<h2>Composition Spells</h2>
<p>You can infuse your performances with magic to create unique effects called compositions. Compositions are a special type of spell that often require you to use the Performance skill when casting them. Composition spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to perform, write a new composition, or otherwise engage your muse.</p>
<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>
<p>You learn the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.WILXkjU5Yq3yw10r]{Counter Performance}</em> composition spell, protecting against auditory and visual effects.</p>
<h3><strong>Composition Cantrips</strong></h3>
<p>Composition cantrips are special composition spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can use them as often as you like. Composition cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from the occult list. Generally, only feats can give you more composition cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out composition cantrips gained from bard feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining. You learn the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.IAjvwqgiDr3qGYxY]{Inspire Courage}</em> composition cantrip, which boosts your allies' attacks, damage, and defense against fear.</p>
<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>
<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>
<h2>Muses</h2>
<p>As a bard, you select one muse at 1st level. This muse leads you to great things, and might be a physical creature, a deity, a philosophy, or a captivating mystery.</p>
<p>Muses can be found here: @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.YMBsi4bndRAk5CX4]{Maestro}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.y0jGimYdMGDJWrEq]{Polymath}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.4ripp6EfdVpS0d60]{Enigma}, and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.N03BtRvjX9TeHRa4]{Warrior}.</p>
<h2>Occult Spellcasting</h2>
<p>You draw upon magic from esoteric knowledge. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a bard, you can usually play an instrument for spells requiring somatic or material components, as long as it takes at least one of your hands to do so. If you use an instrument, you don't need a spell component pouch or another hand free. You can usually also play an instrument for spells requiring verbal components, instead of speaking.</p>
<p>Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>
<p>As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3-6: Bard Spells per Day.</p>
<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>
<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>
<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>
<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>
<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>

<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>
<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level occult spells of your choice and five occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.</p>
<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3-6), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>
<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>
<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>
<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>
<h2>Bard Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 2</span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>
<h2>Skill Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 2</span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>
<h2>General Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>
<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank in Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Signature Spells<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>
<h2>Skill Increases<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>
<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>
<h2>Ability Boosts<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>
<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 7</span></h2>
<p>Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>
<h2>Great Fortitude<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>Your physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Resolve<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>
<h2>Bard Weapon Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>
<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>
<h2>Light Armor Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>
<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 damage if you're a master, and 4 damage if you're legendary.</p>
<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 15</span></h2>
<p>You've mastered the occult. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>
<h2>Greater Resolve<span style="float: right;">Level 17</span></h2>
<p>Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success. When you roll a critical failure at a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>
<h2>Legendary Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 19</span></h2>
<p>Your command of occult magic is the stuff of legends. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>
<h2>Magnum Opus<span style="float: right;">Level 19</span></h2>
<p>You have tuned your spellcasting to the highest caliber. Add two common 10th-level occult spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using bard spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>

<p><em>Vous êtes un individu qui maîtrise son art, qui étudie les secrets bien gardés et qui sait comment captiver et convaincre.

<h2>Ascendance et historique</h2>
<p>En plus des capacités que votre classe vous accorde au niveau 1, vous bénéficiez des avantages de votre ascendance et de votre historique.</p>
<h2>Les sorts de composition</h2>
<p>Vous pouvez injecter de la magie dans vos représentations pour créer des effets uniques appelés compositions. Les compositions forment un type spécial de sorts dont l’incantation nécessite souvent l’utilisation de la compétence Représentation. Les sorts de composition forment un type particulier de sorts focalisés. Il faut dépenser 1 point de focalisation pour lancer un sort focalisé et vous commencez avec une réserve de focalisation int. Elle se remplit lors de vos préparatifs quotidiens et vous pouvez récupérer 1 point de focalisation en utilisant l’activité Refocaliser et en consacrant dix minutes à pratiquer votre art, à créer une nouvelle œuvre ou autre.</p>
<p>Un sort focalisé est automatiquement intensifié à la moitié de votre niveau, comme un tour de magie. Un sort focalisé n’a pas besoin d’emplacement de sort et vous ne pouvez pas utiliser un tel emplacement pour le lancer. Certains dons accordent d’autres sorts focalisés et augmentent la taille de votre réserve de focalisation, bien que cette dernière ne puisse jamais contenir plus de 3 points.</p>
<p>Vous apprenez le sort de composition <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.WILXkjU5Yq3yw10r]{Contre-représentation}</em> qui vous protège contre les effets audibles et visuels.</p>
<h3><strong>Les tours de magie de composition</strong></h3>
<p>Les tours de magie de composition sont des sorts de compositions spéciaux qui ne coûtent aucun point de focalisation ; vous pouvez donc les utiliser autant de fois que voulu. Ces tours de magie s’ajoutent à ceux que vous sélectionnez dans la liste des tours de magie occultes. Généralement, seuls des dons peuvent vous permettre d’apprendre d’autres tours de magie de composition. Au contraire des autres tours de magie, vous ne pouvez pas remplacer les tours de magie de composition obtenus grâce à un don de barde lorsque vous montez de niveau, à moins que vous ne remplaciez ce don grâce au réapprentissage.</p>
<p>Vous apprenez le tour de magie de composition <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.IAjvwqgiDr3qGYxY]{Inspiration vaillante}</em> qui améliore les attaques, les dégâts et la résistance à la terreur de vos alliés.</p> 
<h2>Maîtrises initiales</h2>
<p>Au niveau 1, vous obtenez un nombre de maîtrises qui représentent votre entraînement de base. Elles sont indiquées au début de cette classe.</p>
<h2>Les muses</h2>
<p>En tant que barde, vous choisissez une muse au niveau 1. Elle peut être une créature physique, une divinité, une philosophie ou un mystère captivant qui vous pousse à accomplir de grandes choses.</p>
<p>Les différentes muses sont :</p>
<ul>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.N03BtRvjX9TeHRa4]{Muse combattante},</li> 
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.4ripp6EfdVpS0d60]{Muse énigmatique},</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.y0jGimYdMGDJWrEq]{Muse touche-à-tout},</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.YMBsi4bndRAk5CX4]{Muse virtuose}.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Incantation occulte</h2>
<p>Vous exploitez vos connaissances ésotériques pour faire de la magie. Vous lancez des sorts occultes avec l’activité Lancer un sort et fournissez les composants matériels, somatiques et verbaux nécessaires à leur incantation. Puisque vous êtes un barde, vous jouez le plus souvent d’un instrument pour remplacer les composants somatiques ou matériels des sorts, tant qu’il vous faut utiliser au moins une main pour en jouer. Si vous utilisez un instrument de cette façon, vous n’avez pas besoin d’une bourse de composants ou d’une autre main de libre. Vous pouvez aussi, le plus souvent, jouer d’un instrument pour remplacer les composants verbaux des sorts, au lieu de les prononcer à voix haute.</p>
<p>Vous pouvez lancer jusqu’à deux sorts de niveau 1 par jour. Vous devez connaître ces sorts pour les lancer et vous les apprenez grâce à la capacité de classe répertoire de sorts. Le nombre de sorts que vous pouvez préparer chaque jour est représenté par vos emplacements de sort.</p>
<p>En gagnant des niveaux en tant que barde, le nombre de sorts, ainsi que le niveau de sorts le plus élevé, que vous pouvez lancer quotidiennement augmentent, comme indiqué dans le tableau des sorts de barde par jour.</p>
<p>Certains sorts exigent un jet d’attaque de sort pour déterminer leur efficacité ou obligent vos ennemis à faire un jet contre leur DD (en général un jet de sauvegarde). Comme le Charisme est votre caractéristique essentielle, vos jets d’attaque de sort et vos DD utilisent votre modificateur de Charisme.</p>
<h3><strong>Les sorts intensifiés</strong></h3>
<p>Quand vous obtenez des emplacements de sort de niveau 2 et plus, vous pouvez les remplir avec des versions plus puissantes de sorts de niveau inférieur. Ceci augmente le niveau du sort pour qu’il corresponde à celui de l’emplacement. Vous devez avoir, dans votre répertoire de sorts, un sort au niveau où vous souhaitez le lancer pour pouvoir l’intensifier de cette façon. Nombre de sorts possèdent des améliorations spécifiques quand ils sont intensifiés à un niveau donné. La capacité de classe sorts emblématiques vous permet d’intensifier certains sorts sans prendre en compte ces restrictions.</p>
<h3><strong>Les tours de magie</strong></h3>
<p>Certains de vos sorts sont des tours de magie. Un tour de magie est un type de sort qui n’utilise pas d’emplacement de sort. Il se lance à volonté chaque jour, aussi souvent que vous le désirez. Un tour de magie est toujours automatiquement intensifié jusqu’à la moitié de votre niveau arrondi à l’entier supérieur, donc généralement égal au sort de plus haut niveau que vous pouvez lancer en tant que barde. Par exemple, les tours de magie d’un barde de niveau 1 sont de niveau 1, tandis que ceux d’un barde de niveau 5 sont de niveau 3.</p>

<h2>Répertoire de sorts</h2>
<p>On appelle répertoire de sorts l’ensemble des sorts que vous savez lancer. Au niveau 1, vous apprenez deux sorts occultes de niveau 1 ainsi que cinq tours de magie occultes de votre choix. Vous les choisissez dans la liste des sorts occultes courants ou parmi les autres sorts occultes auxquels vous avez accès. Vous pouvez lancer un sort de votre répertoire en utilisant un emplacement de sort du niveau correspondant.</p>
<p>Vous ajoutez des sorts à votre répertoire au fur et à mesure que vous gagnez des niveaux. Chaque fois que vous obtenez un emplacement de sort, vous ajoutez un sort du même niveau dans votre répertoire. Au niveau 2, vous choisissez un autre sort de niveau 1 ; au niveau 3, vous choisissez deux sorts de niveau 2, etc. Quand vous ajoutez des sorts, vous pouvez choisir la version de niveau supérieurd’un sort que vous connaissez déjà afin de pouvoir lancer une version intensifiée de ce sort.</p>
<p>Même si vous les obtenez au même rythme, vos emplacements de sort et les sorts dans votre répertoire sont deux choses distinctes. Si un don ou une autre capacité vous permet d’ajouter un sort à votre répertoire, cela ne vous donne pas pour autant un nouvel emplacement de sort, et vice versa.</p>
<h3><strong>Remplacer des sorts de votre répertoire</strong></h3>
<p>Lorsque vous ajoutez de nouveaux sorts dans votre répertoire, vous avez la possibilité de remplacer certains des sorts que vous connaissez déjà. Chaque fois que vous gagnez un niveau et que vous apprenez des sorts nouveaux, vous pouvez remplacer l’un de vos anciens sorts par un sort différent du même niveau. Ce sort peut être un tour de magie. Vous pouvez également remplacer des sorts grâce au réapprentissage durant les intermèdes.</p>
<h2>Dons de barde<span style="float: right;">Niveau 2</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 2, puis tous les deux niveaux, vous gagnez un don de classe de barde.</p>
<h2>Dons de compétences<span style="float: right;">Niveau 2</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 2, puis tous les deux niveaux, vous gagnez un don de compétence. Ces dons disposent du trait compétence. Pour choisir un don de compétence, vous devez être au moins qualifié dans la compétence correspondante.</p>
<h2>Dons généraux<span style="float: right;">Niveau 3</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 3, puis tous les quatre niveaux, vous gagnez un don général.</p>
<h2>Réflexes fulgurants<span style="float: right;">Niveau 3</span></h2>
<p>Vos réflexes sont fulgurants. Votre rang de maîtrise pour les jets de Réflexes passe à expert.</p>
<h2>Sorts emblématiques<span style="float: right;">Niveau 3</span></h2>
<p>L’expérience vous permet de lancer certains sorts avec plus de souplesse. Pour chaque niveau de sort auquel vous avez accès, choisissez un sort de ce niveau pour en faire un sort emblématique. Vous n’avez pas besoin d’apprendre une à une les versions intensifiées des sorts emblématiques ; en fait, vous pouvez intensifier sans contrainte ces sorts. Si vous connaissez un sort emblématique à un niveau supérieur à son niveau minimum, vous pouvez également lancer toutes ses versions de niveau inférieur sans avoir à les apprendre séparément. Si vous remplacez un sort emblématique, vous pouvez l’échanger contre un autre sort emblématique de même niveau que celui auquel vous avez appris celui que vous remplacez. Vous pouvez également suivre un réapprentissage juste pour changer un sort emblématique par un autre de même niveau sans passer par le remplacement ; ceci demande autant de temps que le réapprentissage normal d’un sort.</p>
<h2>Améliorations de compétence<span style="float: right;">Niveau 3</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 3, puis tous les deux niveaux, vous gagnez une amélioration de compétence. Vous pouvez utiliser cette amélioration pour augmenter votre rang de maîtrise et devenir qualifié dans une compétence dans laquelle vous étiez inexpérimenté ou pour améliorer votre rang dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes déjà qualifié pour devenir expert.</p>
<p>À partir du niveau 7, vous pouvez utiliser l’amélioration de compétence pour devenir maître dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes déjà expert et à partir du niveau 15, vous pouvez l’utiliser pour devenir légendaire dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes déjà maître.</p>
<h2>Primes de caractéristiques<span style="float: right;">Niveau 5</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 5, puis tous les cinq niveaux, vous améliorez quatre caractéristiques différentes. Vous pouvez utiliser ces primes de caractéristique pour faire passer une valeur decaractéristique au-dessus de 18. La prime augmente la valeur de caractéristique de 1 si elle est déjà de 18 ou plus ou de 2 si elle est inférieure à 18.</p>
<h2>Dons ancestraux<span style="float: right;">Niveau 5</span></h2>
<p>Vous gagnez un don ancestral au niveau 5 puis tous les quatre niveaux, en plus de celui avec lequel vous avez commencé.</p>
<h2>Incantateur expert<span style="float: right;">Niveau 7</span></h2>
<p>Vos rangs de maîtrise pour les jets d’attaque de sort occulte et le DD des sorts passent à expert.</p>
<h2>Vigueur surhumaine<span style="float: right;">Niveau 9</span></h2>
<p>Vous bénéficiez d’une constitution et d’une robustesse extraordinaires. Votre rang de maîtrise pour les jets de Vigueur passe à expert.</p>
<h2>Résolution<span style="float: right;">Niveau 9</span></h2>
<p>Votre résolution cuirasse votre esprit. Votre rang de maîtrise pour les jets de Volonté passe à maître. Quand vous obtenez un succès sur un jet de Volonté, vous remportez à la place un succès critique.</p>
<h2>Expertise avec les armes du barde<span style="float: right;">Niveau 11</span></h2>
<p>Vous êtes à présent un véritable expert du maniement des armes de barde. Vous gagnez le rang de maîtrise expert avec les armes simples, les attaques à mains nues, ainsi que l’épée longue, la rapière, la matraque, l’arc court, l’épée courte et le fouet. Quand vous obtenez un succès critique à un jet d’attaque avec l’une de ces armes pendant que l’une de vos compositions est active, vous appliquez l’effet critique spécialisé de cette arme.</p>
<h2>Sens alertes<span style="float: right;">Niveau 11</span></h2>
<p>Au cours de vos aventures, vous avez développé une conscience aiguë de votre environnement et portez une grande attention aux détails. Votre rang de maîtrise en Perception passe à maître.</p>
<h2>Expertise avec les armures légères<span style="float: right;">Niveau 13</span></h2>
<p>Vous avez appris à esquiver tout en portant une armure légère. Votre rang de maîtrise avec les armures légères et la défense sans armure devient expert.</p>
<h2>Spécialisation martiale<span style="float: right;">Niveau 13</span></h2>
<p>Vous avez appris à infliger de graves blessures avec les armes que vous connaissez le mieux. Vous infligez 2 dégâts supplémentaires avec les armes et les attaques à mains nues pour lesquelles vous êtes expert. Ces dégâts passent à 3 si vous êtes maître et à 4 si vous êtes légendaire.</p>
<h2>Maître incantateur<span style="float: right;">Niveau 15</span></h2>
<p>Vous êtes à présent un maître de la magie occulte. Vos rangs de maîtrise pour les jets d’attaque de sort occulte et le DD des sorts occultes passent à maître.</p>
<h2>Résolution supérieure<span style="float: right;">Niveau 17</span></h2>
<p>Vos entraînements poussés vous ont permis de développer une incroyable résistance mentale. Votre rang de maîtrise des jets de sauvegarde de Volonté devient légendaire. Quand vous obtenez un succès sur un jet de Volonté, vous remportez à la place un succès critique. Quand vous obtenez un échec critique sur un jet de Volonté, celui-ci se transforme en échec. Lorsque vous obtenez un échec sur le jet de Volonté contre un effet qui vous inflige des dégâts, vous ne subissez que la moitié des dégâts.</p>
<h2>Incantateur légendaire<span style="float: right;">Niveau 19</span></h2>
<p>Votre maîtrise de la magie occulte fait figure de légende. Vos rangs de maîtrise pour les jets d’attaque de sorts occultes et le DD des sorts occultes passent à légendaire.</p>
<h2>Magnum Opus<span style="float: right;">Niveau 19</span></h2>
<p>Vos capacités d’incantation frisent à présent la perfection. Ajoutez deux sorts occultes courants de niveau 10 à votre répertoire. Vous gagnez un unique emplacement de sort de niveau 10 que vous pouvez utiliser pour lancer l’un de ces deux sorts avec la capacité d’incantation du barde. Au contraire des emplacements de sorts, vous ne gagnez aucun autre sort de niveau 10 lorsque vous montez de niveau, et vous ne pouvez pas utiliser les emplacements de niveau 10 avec des pouvoirs qui vous confèrent plus d’emplacements de sorts ou qui vous permettent de lancer des sorts sans dépenser d’emplacements.</p>
