Name: Alchemist
Nom: Alchimiste
État: officielle

------ Description (en) ------
<p><em>There's no sight more beautiful to you than a strange brew bubbling in a beaker, and you consume your ingenious elixirs with abandon. You're fascinated by uncovering the secrets of science and the natural world, and you're constantly experimenting in your lab or on the go with inventive concoctions for every eventuality. You are fearless in the face of risk, hurling explosive or toxic creations at your foes. Your unique path toward greatness is lined with alchemical brews that push your mind and body to their limits.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Ability: INTELLIGENCE</strong></p>
<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability bonus to Intelligence</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>
<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>
<h1>Roleplaying the Alchemist</h1>
<h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2>
<p>You lob bombs at your foes, harry your enemies, and support the rest of your party with potent elixirs. At higher levels, your mutagens warp your body into a resilient and powerful weapon.</p>
<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>
<p>You provide knowledge and experience about alchemical items and related secrets, such as poisons and diseases.</p>
<h2>While Exploring...</h2>
<p>You keep an eye out for trouble with your bombs at the ready, while giving advice on all things alchemical and mysterious.</p>
<h2>In Downtime...</h2>
<p>You experiment in an alchemical lab, brewing elixirs, making bombs, and furthering your alchemical knowledge.</p>
<h2>You Might...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy tinkering with strange formulas and alchemical reagents, often with a single-minded dedication and recklessness that gives others pause.</li>
<li>Get a kick out of wreaking havoc with the alchemical concoctions you've made, and enjoy watching things burn, dissolve, freeze, and jolt.</li>
<li>Endlessly experiment to discover new, more potent alchemical tools.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Others Probably...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Think you're some kind of sorcerer or an eccentric wizard and don't understand that you don't cast spells; spellcasters who clumsily dabble in alchemy only heighten this misconception.</li>
<li>Don't understand your zeal for alchemy, creativity, and invention.</li>
<li>Assume that if you haven't caused a catastrophe with your experimentations, you inevitably will.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1>

<h2>Alchemist Feats</h2>
<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain an alchemist class feat.</p>
<h2>Alchemy</h2>
<p>You understand the complex interactions of natural and unnatural substances and can concoct alchemical items to meet your needs. You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use special infused reagents that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science.</p>
<p>You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.is3Oz9wt11lNq62K]{Alchemical Crafting} feat, even if you don't meet that feat's prerequisites, and you gain the four common 1st-level alchemical formulas granted by that feat. You can use this feat to create alchemical items as long as you have the items' formulas in your formula book.</p>
<h3><strong>Infused Reagents</strong></h3>
<p>You infuse reagents with your own alchemical essence, allowing you to create alchemical items at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you gain a number of batches of infused reagents equal to your level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use these reagents for either advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy, described below. Together, these infused reagents have light Bulk.</p>
<p>As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your infused reagents from the previous day's preparations are instantly destroyed, and nonpermanent effects of your previous day's infused items immediately end. While infused reagents are physical objects, they can't be duplicated, preserved, or created in any way other than your daily preparations. Any such artificial reagents lack the infusion and are useless for advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy.</p>
<h3><strong>Advanced Alchemy</strong></h3>
<p>During your daily preparations, after producing new infused reagents, you can spend batches of those infused reagents to create infused alchemical items. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical reagent requirements. Your advanced alchemy level is equal to your level. For each batch of infused reagents you spend, choose an alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book, and make a batch of two of that item. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.</p>
<h3><strong>Quick Alchemy</strong></h3>
<p>If you need a specific alchemical item on the fly, you can use your infused reagents to quickly create it with the Quick Alchemy action.</p>
<h3>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.NlEZ0piDxg9buXCL]{Quick Alchemy}<span class="pf2-icon">A</span></h3>
<p><strong>Cost</strong> 1 batch of infused reagents</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.4ftXXUCBHcf4b0MH]{Alchemist's Tools}, the formula for the alchemical item you're creating, and a free hand.</p>
<hr />
<p>You swiftly mix up a short-lived alchemical item to use at a moment's notice. You create a single alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book without having to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical reagents or needing to attempt a Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until the start of your next turn.</p>
<h3><strong>Formula Book</strong></h3>
<p>An alchemist keeps meticulous records of the formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard formula book worth 10 sp or less for free. The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to those you gained from Alchemical Crafting and your research field.</p>
<p>Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to invent them with the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.XR95taODq1sq82Du]{Inventor} feat.</p>
<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>
<p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>
<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>
<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>
<h2>Research Field</h2>
<p>Your inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe have led you to focus on a particular field of research. You might have a degree from an scientific institute, correspond with other researchers in your field, or work as a genius loner. Choose a field of research.</p>
<p>Your research field adds a number of formulas to your formulas book; these are your signature items. When using a batch of infused reagents to create your signature items using advanced alchemy, you can create three items instead of two. Each time you gain a level, you can swap one of your signature items with another formula in your formula book. This new signature item must be on your research field's list of possible signature items.</p>
<p>Research fields can be found here (@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.7JbiaZ8bxODM5mzS]{Bomber}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.eNZnx4LISDNftbx2]{Chirurgeon}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.tvdb1jkjl2bRZjSp]{Mutagenist} and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.P9quO9XZi3OWFe1k]{Toxicologist}).</p>
<h2>Skill Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 2</span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>

<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>
<h2>Skill Increases<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>
<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>
<h2>Ability Boosts<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>
<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>

You gain the ability to create two 1st-level alchemical items using Quick Alchemy without spending a batch of infused reagents. The items you can select depend on your research field and must be in your formula book.</p>
<p>See specific research fields for more information.</p>
<h2>Alchemical Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>Constant practice has increased the effectiveness of your concoctions. Your proficiency rank for your alchemist class DC increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Alertness<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Double Brew<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>You know your formulas so well that you can concoct two items at once. When using the Quick Alchemy action, instead of spending one batch of infused reagents to create a single item, you can spend up to two batches of infused reagents to make up to two alchemical items as described in that action. These items do not have to be the same.</p>
<h2>Juggernaut<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>Your body has become accustomed to physical hazards and resistant to pathogens and ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>

<h2>Dons d’alchimiste</h2>
<p>Au niveau 1, puis à tous les niveaux pairs, vous gagnez un don de classe d’alchimiste.</p>
<h2>Alchimie</h2>
<p>Vous comprenez les règles régissant les interactions complexes entre les substances naturelles et non naturelles et vous savez concocter des objets alchimiques répondant à vos besoins. Vous pouvez accomplir cela en utilisant des réactifs normaux combinés avec l’activité Artisanat, ou vous pouvez utiliser des réactifs imprégnés spéciaux qui vous permettent de fabriquer des objets temporaires, rapidement et sans coût associé. Au fil du temps, vous apprendrez à créer de plus en plus d’objets alchimiques gratuitement et, dans la mesure où ceux-ci deviennent toujours plus efficaces, vous deviendrez également beaucoup plus puissant et laisserez derrière vous ceux qui ne comprennent rien à votre étrange science.</p>
<p>Vous gagnez le don @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.is3Oz9wt11lNq62K]{Artisanat alchimique}, même si vous ne répondez pas aux prérequis de ce don et vous apprenez les quatre formules alchimiques courantes de niveau 1 conférées par ce don. Vous pouvez utiliser ce don pour créer des objets alchimiques aussi longtemps que vous possédez les formules correspondant à ces objets dans votre formulaire d’alchimie.</p>
<h3><strong>réactifs imprégnés</strong></h3>
<p>Vous imprégnez vos réactifs avec votre propre essence alchimique et êtes ainsi en mesure de créer des objets alchimiques sans coût associé. Chaque jour, lors de vos préparatifs quotidiens, vous gagnez une quantité de lots de réactifs imprégnés égale à votre niveau + votre modificateur d’Intelligence. Vous pouvez utiliser ces réactifs dans le cadre de votre alchimie avancée ou de votre Alchimie rapide, toutes deux décrites ci-dessous. L’ensemble de ces réactifs imprégnés représentent un Encombrement léger.</p>
<p>Dès que vous commencez vos préparatifs quotidiens en prévision d’une nouvelle journée, les réactifs imprégnés que vous avez obtenus lors de vos préparatifs de la veille sont instantanément détruits et tous les effets non permanents de vos objets imprégnés de la veille prennent immédiatement fin. Bien que vos réactifs imprégnés soient des objets physiques, ils ne peuvent pas être dupliqués, préservés ou créés autrement que dans le cadre de vos préparatifs quotidiens. Les réactifs obtenus ainsi de façon artificielle ne sont pas imprégnés et ne peuvent pas être utilisés avec l’alchimie avancée ou l’Alchimie rapide.</p>
<h3><strong>Alchimie avancée</strong></h3>
<p>Au cours de vos préparatifs quotidiens, vous créez de nouveaux réactifs imprégnés que vous pouvez utiliser pour créer des objets alchimiques imprégnés. Pour accomplir ceci, vous n’avez pas besoin de faire de test d’Artisanat et vous ne tenez pas compte de la durée en jours nécessaire pour fabriquer ces objets ni des réactifs alchimiques demandés. Votre niveau d’alchimie avancée est égal à votre niveau. Pour chaque lot de réactifs imprégnés utilisé, choisissez un objet alchimique dont le niveau est inférieur ou égal à votre niveau d’alchimie avancée et qui se trouve dans votre formulaire. Vous fabriquez alors un lot de deux objets de ce type. Ces objets ont le trait imprégné et sont efficaces pendant une durée maximum de 24 heures ou jusqu’à vos prochains préparatifs quotidiens.</p>
<h3><strong>Alchimie rapide</strong></h3>
<p>Si vous avez besoin d’un objet alchimique à la volée, vous pouvez utiliser vos réactifs imprégnés pour le créer rapidement grâce à l’action Alchimie rapide.</p>
<h3>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.NlEZ0piDxg9buXCL]{Alchimie rapide}<span class="pf2-icon">A</span></h3>
<p><strong>Coût</strong> 1 lot de réactifs imprégnés<br /><strong>Conditions</strong> Vous avez des @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.4ftXXUCBHcf4b0MH]{outils d’alchimiste}, la formule de l’objet alchimique que vous créez et une main libre.</p>
<hr />
<p>Vous préparez rapidement un objet alchimique périssable que vous pouvez utiliser sur‑le‑champ. Vous pouvez créer un unique objet alchimique d’un niveau inférieur ou égal à votre niveau d’alchimie avancée et qui se trouve dans votre formulaire, sans avoir à dépenser le coût monétaire normal en réactifs alchimiques ou à faire de test d’Artisanat. Cet objet possède le trait imprégné, mais il ne reste efficace que jusqu’au début de votre prochain tour.</p>
<h3><strong>Formulaire</strong></h3>
<p>Un alchimiste conserve méticuleusement les formules de chaque objet qu'il peut créer. Quand vous commencez, vous obtenez gratuitement un recueil de formules valant 10 pa ou moins. Ce formulaire contient les formules de deux objets alchimiques courants de niveau 1 de votre choix, en plus de celles que vous obtenez grâce à Artisanat alchimique et à votre domaine de recherche.</p>
<p>À chaque fois que vous gagnez un niveau, vous pouvez ajouter les formules de deux objets alchimiques courants à votre formulaire. Vous devez choisir des formules pour des objets d’un niveau que vous pouvez créer. Vous apprenez ces nouvelles formules automatiquement, mais vous pouvez également trouver ou acheter des formules supplémentaires dans des agglomérations ou auprès d’autres alchimistes, ou encore les inventer grâce au don @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.XR95taODq1sq82Du]{Inventeur}</p>
<h2>Ascendance et historique</h2>
<p>En plus des capacités que votre classe vous accorde au niveau 1, vous bénéficiez des avantages de votre ascendance et de votre historique.</p>
<h2>Maîtrises initiales</h2>
<p>Au niveau 1, vous obtenez un nombre de maîtrises qui représentent votre entraînement de base. Elles sont indiquées au début de cette classe.</p>
<h2 class="title">Domaine de recherche</h2>
<p>Votre étude de la nature alchimique de l’univers vous a mené à vous concentrer sur un domaine de recherche spécifique. Vous avez peut-être obtenu un diplôme d’un institut scientifique, correspondez avec d’autres chercheurs dans votre domaine ou êtes un génie solitaire. Choisissez un domaine de recherche. </p>
<p>Votre domaine de recherche ajoute un nombre de formules à votre formulaire ; il s'agit de vos objets emblématiques. Lorsque vous utilisez un lot de réactifs imprégnés pour créer vos objets emblématiques en utilisant alchimie avancée, vous créez trois objets au lieu de deux. Chaque fois que vous obtenez un niveau, vous pouvez échanger un de vos objets emblématiques avec une autre formule de votre formulaire. Ce nouvel objet emblématique doit être un de ceux qui figure sur la liste des objets possibles de votre domaine de recherche.</p>
<p>Les domaines de recherche sont les suivants :</p>
