------ Description (en) ------
<p><em>Your conduit to divine power eschews the traditional channels of prayer </em><em>and servitude-you instead glean divine truths that extend beyond any </em><em>single deity. You understand the great mysteries of the universe embodied in </em><em>overarching concepts that transcend good and evil or chaos and law, whether because you </em><em>perceive the common ground across multiple deities or circumvent their power entirely.</em></p>
<p><em>You explore one of these mysteries and draw upon its power to cast miraculous spells, </em><em>but that power comes with a terrible price: a curse that grows stronger the more you </em><em>draw upon it. Your abilities are a double-edged sword, which you might uphold as an </em><em>instrument of the divine or view as a curse from the gods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Ability: CHARISMA</strong></p>
<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability bonus to Charisma</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>
<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>
<h1>Roleplaying the Oracle</h1>
<h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2>
<p>You draw upon your mystery to empower yourself in combat, balancing miraculous effects with the increasing severity of your curse as conflicting divine demands overtax your physical body. You cast spells to aid your allies and devastate your foes, or depending on your mystery, you might wade into battle yourself.</p>
<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>
<p>You rely upon the insights drawn from your mystery. You might leverage your curse to intimidate people or hide its effects to better blend in.</p>
<h2>While Exploring...</h2>
<p>You recenter yourself to bring the terrible metaphysical conflicts causing your curse back under control so you can draw upon your mystery's power again later. You remain aware of supernatural forces acting around you, perhaps peeking into the future to gain insights.</p>
<h2>In Downtime...</h2>
<p>You might seek to learn more about your mystery and the divine wellsprings that fuel your power. Associating with others interested in the subject of your mystery can make it easier to live with your curse. You could associate with an organized religion or even start your own faithful following devoted to your mystery.</p>
<h2>You Might...</h2>
<ul>
<li>View your oracular powers as a blessing, a curse, or both.</li>
<li>Push yourself to the limits of what you can withstand to work great acts of magic.</li>
<li>Rely on magical items to provide a pool of safer and more reliable magic.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Others Probably...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don't realize your spellcasting draws upon divine power and instead believe you command stranger-and possibly evil-powers.</li>
<li>Assume you performed some terrible transgression to become cursed by the gods.</li>
<li>Admire your determination and the sacrifices you make to perform wondrous acts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>
<p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>
<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>
<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>
<h2>Divine Spellcasting</h2>
<p>Your mystery provides you with divine magical power. You can cast spells using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell} activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Your unconventional access to this divine power means you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a material component pouch when casting spells.</p>
<p>At 1st level, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells per day. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as an oracle, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2-3: Oracle Spells per Day.</p>
<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>
<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>
<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. To cast a heightened spell, you must have the heightened version in your repertoire; for example, you can't cast a 3rd-level version of a spell that is only in your repertoire at 1st level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>
<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>
<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as an oracle. For example, as a 1st-level oracle, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level oracle, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>

<h2>Spell Repetoire</h2>
<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the divine spell list, or from other divine spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.</p>
<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2-3), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>
<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></p>
<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>
<h2>Mystery</h2>
<p>An oracle wields divine power, but not from a single divine being. This power could come from a potent concept or ideal, the attention of multiple divine entities whose areas of concern all touch on that subject, or a direct and dangerous conduit to raw divine power. This is the oracle's mystery, a source of divine magic not beholden to any deity.</p>
<p>Choose the mystery that empowers your magic. Your mystery grants you special spells called revelation spells and might later grant you divine domain spells. It dictates the effects of your oracular curse, adds an additional cantrip to your repertoire, and gives you one or more trained skills. Drawing insight and power from the collective divine influences that fuel your magic also provides you with a special benefit.</p>
<p>The following oracle mysteries are presented in this book.</p>
<ul>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.qvRlih3u7vK3FYUR]{Ancestors}: Voices of past generations teach and haunt you.</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.gjOGOR30Czpnx3tM]{Battle}: You embody the virtues upheld by heroes of legend.</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.IaxmCkdsPlA52spu]{Bones}: Death always seems near, and the dead speak to you.</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.RI2EMRBBPNSoTJXu]{Cosmos}: You draw power from the stars and the spaces between.</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.GTSvbFb36InvuH0w]{Flames}: You dance with fire and do your best to remain unscorched by it.</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.o1gGG36wpn9mxeop]{Life}: The teeming energies of life flow through you out into the world.</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.tZBb3Kh4nJcNoUFI]{Lore}: You gain access to unparalleled, overwhelming knowledge.</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.W9cF7wZztLDb1WGY]{Tempest}: Wind, waves, and storms rage at your beck and call.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Revelation Spells</strong></p>
<p>The powers of your mystery manifest in the form of revelation spells, which are a type of focus spell. Casting a revelation spell costs 1 Focus Point and increases the effects of your oracular curse. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Refocus}activity to reconcile the conflicting or unconventional nature of your divine mystery.</p>
<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>
<p>Revelation spells have the cursebound trait, unlike other focus spells. This trait means they increase the severity of your oracular curse (see below) when cast. You can't cast a cursebound spell if you don't have an oracular curse.</p>
<p>You learn two revelation spells at 1st level. The first is an initial revelation spell determined by your mystery. The second is an initial domain spell you select from one of the domains associated with your mystery, which you cast as a revelation spell, causing it to gain the cursebound trait.</p>
<p><strong>Oracular Curse</strong></p>
<p>Drawing on multiple disparate sources of power inevitably places an incredible stress on your body, manifesting as a supernatural curse. The more revelation spells you cast, the worse the effects of your curse, but these increasingly conflicting energies can also provide you with divine benefits.</p>
<p>The specific effects of your curse are tied to your mystery, but all curses follow the same progression. A curse continually gives you a mild but constant reminder that you carry otherworldly power. As you cast revelation spells, your curse intensifies, first to a minor effect and then to a moderate effect.</p>
<p>Your curse progresses to its minor stage the first time you finish casting a revelation spell after your daily preparations. Once your minor curse has manifested, it remains in effect until you rest for 8 hours and again make your daily preparations. If you cast a revelation spell while your minor curse is in effect, you progress to the moderate curse effect immediately after you finish Casting the Spell. The minor effect continues to affect you, though some moderate curse effects might alter the specifics of your minor curse. At higher levels, you can cast more revelation spells, progressing your curse to its major stage and then an extreme stage; these stronger curses are cumulative with the effects of the lower stages and can alter them. When you Refocus while under the effects of your moderate or stronger curse, you reduce your curse's severity to minor in addition to regaining a Focus Point.</p>
<p>Drawing upon your mystery's power while your curse is at its worst causes an irreconcilable conflict between you and the sources of your power. Immediately after casting a revelation spell while under the moderate effect of your curse, you are overwhelmed. While overwhelmed, you can't Cast or Sustain any revelation spells-you effectively lose access to those spells. You can still Refocus to reduce the effects of your curse and regain a Focus Point, but doing so doesn't allow you to cast further revelation spells. These effects last until you rest for 8 hours and make your daily preparations, at which point your curse returns to its basic state. At higher levels, you can grow to withstand your curse's major and even extreme effects, enabling you to cast more revelation spells without becoming overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Your curse has the curse, divine, and necromancy traits. You can't mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your oracular curse by any means other than Refocusing and resting for 8 hours. For example, if your curse makes creatures @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Gb7SeieEvd0pL2Eh]{True Strike}</em> (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). Likewise, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.OyFCwQuw8XRazsNr]{Remove Curse}</em> and similar spells don't affect your curse at all.</p>
<h2>Oracle Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 2</span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain an oracle class feat.</p>
<h2>Skill Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 2</span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>
<h2>General Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>
<h2>Signature Spells<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>Experience enables you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can replace it with any spell you could have chosen when you first selected it (i.e., of the same spell level or lower). You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>
<h2>Skill Increases<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>
<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>
<h2>Ability Boosts<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>
<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 7</span></h2>
<p>The intricacy of your divine power has grown clearer over time. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>
<h2>Resolve<span style="float: right;">Level 7</span></h2>
<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>
<h2>Magical Fortitude<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Alertness<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Major Curse<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>You've learned to better balance the conflicting powers wreaking havoc on your body. Immediately after completing the casting of a revelation spell while you are affected by your moderate curse, your curse progresses to its major effect, rather than overwhelming you. This effect lasts until you Refocus, which reduces your curse to its minor effect. If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of your major curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse.</p>
<p>In addition, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool from 2 to 3. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>
<h2>Weapon Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>
<h2>Light Armor Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>
<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>
<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 15</span></h2>
<p>You truly understand the deep and complex divine power within your mystery. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>
<h2>Extreme Curse<span style="float: right;">Level 17</span></h2>
<p>You have mastered a perilous balance between the conflicting divine powers of your mystery, gaining the power to change your fate, but straining both body and soul. When you cast a revelation spell while affected by your major curse, your curse intensifies to an extreme effect instead of overwhelming you. All mysteries share the same effects for their extreme curse.</p>
<p>When affected by your extreme curse, you become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed 2} (or increase your doomed condition by 2 if you were already doomed). Once every 10 minutes, when you fail an attack roll, skill or Perception check, or saving throw, you can reroll it and use the second result. The reroll has the fortune trait and doesn't require you to spend an action, meaning you can use the reroll even if you can't act. These effects are in addition to all the effects of your major curse, and they can't be removed by any means until you Refocus to reduce your curse to its minor effect.</p>
<p>If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of this extreme curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse, and you remain doomed 2 even if you Refocus.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you spend at least 3 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 3 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>
<h2>Greater Resolve<span style="float: right;">Level 17</span></h2>
<p>Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>
<h2>Legendary Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 19</span></h2>
<p>You can harness divine power at a level few others can match. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>
<h2>Oracular Clarity<span style="float: right;">Level 19</span></h2>
<p>You now fully grasp the nature of the divine power behind your mystery, allowing you to work magic akin to miracles. Add two common 10th-level divine spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using oracle spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.PExiZZTSP4p7TZaW]{Oracular Providence} feat to gain a second slot.</p>

<p><em>Votre lien avec les puissances divines ne se conforme pas aux voies traditionnelles telles que les prières et la servitude ; au lieu de cela, vous entrevoyez des vérités divines plus vastes que celles de chaque divinité individuelle.

<p><br /><strong>Caractéristique essentielle : CHARISME</strong><br />Au niveau 1, votre classe vous donne une prime de caractéristique de Charisme</p>
<p><strong>Points de vie : 8 plus votre modificateur de Constitution</strong><br />Vous augmentez votre maximum de PV de ce montant au niveau 1, puis à chaque fois que vous gagnez un niveau.</p>
<h1>Jouer un Oracle</h1>
<h2>Lors des rencontres de combat...</h2>
<p>Vous utilisez votre mystère pour accroître votre puissance au combat, en veillant à l'équilibre entre les effets miraculeux que vous produisez et l’augmentation de la sévérité de votre malédiction car les exigences divines contradictoires épuisent votre corps physique. Vous lancez des sorts pour aider vos alliés et semer la destruction sur vos ennemis ou, en fonction de votre mystère, vous vous lancez dans le cœur du combat.</p>
<h2>Durant les rencontres sociales...</h2>
<p>Vous vous appuyez sur les intuitions provenant de votre mystère. Vous tirez peut-être aussi parti de votre malédiction pour intimider les gens ou vous cachez ses effets pour mieux vous fondre dans la masse.</p>
<h2>En exploration...</h2>
<p>Vous vous recentrez sur vous-même pour contrôler les terribles conflits métaphysiques qui produisent votre malédiction, afin de pouvoir à nouveau faire appel plus tard aux pouvoirs de votre mystère. Vous êtes conscient des forces surnaturelles qui agissent autour de vous et allez même peut-être jusqu’à jeter un coup d’œil dans le futur pour affiner vos intuitions.</p>
<h2>Pendant un intermède...</h2>
<p>Vous pourriez tenter d’en apprendre plus au sujet de votre mystère et des sources divines qui sont à l’origine de vos pouvoirs. Vous associer avec d’autres personnes qui sont intéressées par le sujet de votre mystère peut vous aider à vivre avec votre malédiction. Vous pourriez vous associer avec une religion organisée ou même fonder vous-même le culte dédié à votre mystère.
</p>
<h2>Vous...</h2>
<ul>
<li>considérez vos pouvoirs d’oracle comme un don, une malédiction ou les deux à la fois.</li>
<li>poussez jusqu’aux limites de ce que vous pouvez supporter pour réaliser des hauts faits magiques.</li>
<li>comptez sur des objets magiques comme source d’effets magiques moins dangereuse et plus fiable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Les autres...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ne se rendent pas compte que votre magie tire sa source du divin et pensent plutôt que vous manipulez des pouvoirs plus étranges, voire plus sombres.</li>
<li>Supposent que vous avez commis un acte terrible pour que les dieux vous maudissent de la sorte.</li>
<li>Admirent votre détermination et les sacrifices que vous endurez pour produire des actes merveilleux.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Maîtrises initiales</h1>
<p>Au niveau 1, vous gagnez les rangs de maîtrise indiqués pour les statistiques suivantes. Vous êtes inexpérimenté pour tout ce qui ne figure pas ci‑dessous, à moins d’obtenir un rang de maîtrise supérieur d’une autre manière.</p>
<h2>Perception</h2>
<p>Qualifié en Perception</p>
<h2>Jets de sauvegarde</h2>
<p>Qualifié en Vigueur<br />Qualifié en Réflexes <br />Expert en Volonté</p>
<h2>Compétences</h2>
<p>Qualifié en Religion<br />Qualifié en une ou pluseurs compétences déterminées par votre mystère<br />Qualifié en un nombre de compétences supplémentaires égal à 3 plus votre modificateur d'Intelligence</p>
<h2>Attaques</h2>
<p>Qualifié avec les armes simples <br />Qualifié en attaques à mains nues</p>
<h2>Défenses</h2>
<p>Qualifié avec les armures légères<br />Qualifié pour la défense sans armure</p>
<h2>Sorts</h2>
<p>Qualifié pour les attaques de sort divin<br />Qualifié pour le DD des sorts divins</p>

<h2>Ascendance et historique</h2>
p>En plus des pouvoirs que votre classe vous accorde au niveau 1, vous bénéficiez des avantages de votre ascendance et de votre historique.</p>
<h2>Maîtrises initiales</h2>
<p>Au niveau 1, vous obtenez un nombre de maîtrises, indiquées au début de cette classe, qui représentent votre entraînement de base.</p>
<h2>Incantation divine</h2>
<p>Votre mystère vous accorde le pouvoir de lancer des sorts divins. Vous lancez des sorts divins avec l’activité @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Lancer un sort} et vous pouvez fournir des composants matériels, somatiques et verbaux lors de l’incantation. Du fait de votre accès non conventionnel à ce pouvoir divin, vous pouvez normalement remplacer les composants matériels avec des composantes somatiques, de telle façon que vous n'avez pas besoin d’utiliser une bourse de composants.</p>
<p>Au niveau 1, vous pouvez lancer jusqu’à 2 sorts de niveau 1 par jour. Vous devez connaître un sort pour pouvoir le lancer, et vous apprenez les sorts grâce à la capacité de classe de répertoire de sorts. Le nombre de sorts que vous pouvez lancer chaque jour est appelé votre nombre d’emplacements de sorts. Quand vous gagnez des niveaux en tant qu’oracle, le nombre de sorts par jour augmente, tout comme le plus haut niveau de sorts que vous pouvez lancer, comme indiqué sur la table ci-dessous.</p>
<p>Certains de vos sorts nécessitent que vous effectuiez un jet d’attaque de sorts pour voir s’ils sont efficaces ou que votre ennemi lance un jet (généralement un jet de sauvegarde) contre votre DD de sorts. Comme votre caractéristique essentielle est le Charisme, vos jets d’attaque de sorts et vos DD de sorts utilisent votre modificateur de Charisme.</p>
<h3><strong>Sorts intensifiés</strong></h3>
<p>Quand vous obtenez des emplacements de sort de niveau 2 et supérieurs, vous pouvez les remplir avec des versions plus puissantes de sorts de niveau inférieur. Pour lancer un sort intensifié, vous devez avoir la version intensifiée du sort dans votre répertoire ; Par exemple, vous ne pouvez lancé la version d'un sort au niveau 3 qui est seulement dans votre répertoire au niveau 1. Nombre de sorts possèdent des améliorations spécifiques quand ils sont intensifiés à un niveau donné. La capacité de classe sorts emblématiques vous permet d'intensifier certains sorts librement.</p>
<h3><strong>Tours de magie</strong></h3>
<p>Un tour de magie est un type de sort qui n’utilise pas d’emplacement de sort. Il se lance à volonté chaque jour, aussi souvent que vous le désirez. Un tour de magie est toujours automatiquement intensifié jusqu’à la moitié de votre niveau arrondi à l’entier supérieur, donc généralement égal au sort de plus haut niveau que vous pouvez lancer en tant qu'oracle. Par exemple, les tours de magie d’un oracle de niveau 1 sont de niveau 1, tandis que ceux d’un oracle de niveau 5 sont des sorts de niveau 3.

<h2>répertoire de sorts</h2>
<p>L’ensemble des sorts que vous pouvez lancer est appelé votre répertoire de sorts. Au niveau 1, vous apprenez deux sorts de 1er niveau de votre choix et 5 tours de magie de votre choix. Vous pouvez sélectionner ceux-ci parmi les sorts communs de la liste des sorts divins ou les autres sorts divins auxquels vous avez accès. Vous pouvez lancer n’importe un sort se trouvant dans votre répertoire en utilisant un emplacement de sort d’un niveau approprié.</p>
<p>Vous complétez ce répertoire de sorts lorsque vous gagnez des niveaux. Chaque fois que vous obtenez un nouvel emplacement de sorts (voir la table ci-dessus), vous ajoutez un sort du même niveau à votre répertoire de sort. Au niveau 2, vous choisissez un autre sort de 1er niveau ; au niveau 3, vous choisissez deux sorts de 2e niveau ; et ainsi de suite. Quand vous ajoutez des sorts, vous pouvez choisir d’ajouter une version intensifiée d’un sort que vous possédez déjà, de sorte que vous puissiez lancer la version intensifiée de ce sort.</p>
<p>Même si vous gagnez vos emplacements de sorts et les sorts de votre répertoire au même rythme, il s’agit de deux choses différentes. Ainsi, un don ou une autre capacité qui ajouterait un sort à votre répertoire ne vous donnerait pas automatiquement un emplacement de sort de plus, et vice versa.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remplacer les sorts de votre répertoire</strong></p>
<p>Quand vous gagnez de nouveaux sorts dans votre répertoire, vous pouvez choisir de remplacer certains sorts appris précédemment. Chaque fois que vous gagnez un niveau et que vous apprenez de nouveaux sorts, vous pouvez remplacer un de vos anciens sorts par un autre sort du même niveau. Au lieu de cela, vous pouvez remplacer un tour de magie. Vous pouvez aussi remplacer des sorts par d’autres via le ré-entraînement pendant le temps libre.</p>
<h2>Mystère</h2>
<p>L’oracle manipule des pouvoirs divins, mais ceux-ci ne proviennent pas d’une seule entité divine. Ces pouvoirs pourraient venir d’un concept ou d’un idéal puissant, de l’attention combinée de plusieurs entités divines dont les thèmes sont tous liés à ce sujet ou d’un lien direct et dangereux avec du pouvoir divin brut. C’est le mystère de l’oracle, une source de magie divine qui ne provient pas d’une unique entité divine.</p>
<p>Choisissez le mystère d’où votre magie provient. Votre mystère vous donne des sorts spéciaux appelés sorts de révélation et pourrait, plus tard, vous donner des sorts de domaine divins. Il détermine aussi les effets de votre malédiction oraculaire, ajoute un tour de magie supplémentaire à votre répertoire et vous donne un entraînement dans une ou plusieurs compétences. Le fait de puiser votre intuition et vos pouvoirs dans le collectif d’influences divines qui vous donne accès à la magie vous procure également un avantage spécifique.</p>
<p>Les mystères d'oracle disponibles sont les suivants :</p>
<ul>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.qvRlih3u7vK3FYUR]{Ancêtres} : les voix des générations passées vous enseignent et vous hantent.</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.gjOGOR30Czpnx3tM]{Combat} : vous incarnez les vertus des héros légendaires.</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.RI2EMRBBPNSoTJXu]{Cosmos} : vous tirez vos pouvoirs des étoiles et de l'espace qui les séparent.</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.GTSvbFb36InvuH0w]{Flammes} : vous dansez avec le feu et vous faites de votre mieux pour ne pas vous embraser.</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.IaxmCkdsPlA52spu]{Ossements} : la mort semble toujours être proche et les morts vous parlent.</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.tZBb3Kh4nJcNoUFI]{Savoir} : vous gagnez accès à des connaissances inégalables mais écrasantes.</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.W9cF7wZztLDb1WGY]{Tempête} : le vent, les vagues et les tempêtes déferlent à votre appel.</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.o1gGG36wpn9mxeop]{Vie} : les énergies bouillonnantes de la vie affluent à travers vous et se déversent sur le monde.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sorts de révélation</strong></p>
<p>Les pouvoirs de votre mystère se manifestent sous la forme de sorts de révélation, qui sont une sorte de sorts de focalisation. Lancer un sort de révélation coûte 1 Point de Focalisation et augmente les effets de votre malédiction oraculaire (voir ci-dessous). Vous commencez avec une réserve de 2 Points de Focalisation. Vous remplissez votre réserve au cours de vos préparatifs quotidiens et vous pouvez regagner 1 Point de Focalisation en passant 10 minutes, via l’activité @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Se Refocaliser}, à tenter de réconcilier la nature conflictuelle ou inhabituelle de votre mystère divin.</p>
<p>Les sorts de focalisation sont automatiquement intensifiés à la moitié de votre niveau arrondi au niveau supérieur. Les sorts de focalisation ne nécessitent pas d’emplacements de sorts et vous ne pouvez pas les lancer via des emplacements de sorts. Certains dons peuvent vous donner des sorts de focalisation supplémentaires et accroître la taille de votre réserve de focalisation, mais celle-ci ne peut jamais contenir plus de 3 Points de Focalisation.</p>
<p>Contrairement aux autres sorts de focalisation, les sorts de révélation possèdent le trait « Malédiction oraculaire ». Ce trait signifie qu’ils augmentent la sévérité de votre malédiction oraculaire (voir plus bas) quand ils sont lancés. Vous ne pouvez pas lancer un sort possédant ce trait sans avoir de malédiction oraculaire.</p>
<p>Vous apprenez deux sorts de révélation au niveau 1. Le premier est le sort de révélation initial déterminé par votre mystère. Le second est un sort de domaine initial que vous choisissez dans l’un des domaines associés avec votre mystère et que vous lancez sous la forme de sort de révélation, ce qui lui ajoute le trait « Malédiction oraculaire ».</p>
<p><strong>Malédiction oraculaire</strong></p>
<p>Le fait de puiser dans plusieurs sources disparates de puissance soumet inévitablement votre corps à une incroyable pression, qui se manifeste sous la forme d’une malédiction surnaturelle. Plus vous lancez de sorts de révélation et pires sont les effets de votre malédiction, mais ces énergies de plus en plus conflictuelles peuvent également vous accorder des avantages divins.</p>
<p>Les effets spécifiques de votre malédiction sont liés à votre mystère, mais toutes les malédictions suivent la même progression. La malédiction vous procure un rappel léger mais constant du fait que vous possédez des pouvoirs provenant d’ailleurs. Lorsque vous lancez des sorts de révélation, votre malédiction s’intensifie, tout d’abord vers un effet mineur, puis ensuite vers un effet modéré.</p>
<p>Votre malédiction progresse vers son stade mineur la première fois que vous terminez de lancer un sort de révélation après vos préparatifs quotidiens. Une fois que votre malédiction mineure s’est produite, elle reste en place jusqu’à ce que vous vous soyez reposé pendant 8 heures et accompli de nouveaux préparatifs quotidiens. Si vous lancez un sort de révélation alors que votre malédiction mineure est active, vous progressez immédiatement vers la malédiction modérée après avoir fini de Lancer un sort. L’effet mineur continue de vous affecter, mais certains effets modérés peuvent modifier les détails de la malédiction mineure. À plus haut niveau, vous pouvez lancer plus de sorts de révélation, ce qui peut faire progresser votre malédiction jusqu’au stade majeur, puis au stade extrême ; ces malédictions plus sévères se cumulent avec les effets des stades précédents et peuvent modifier ceux-ci. Lorsque vous Vous Refocalisez alors que vous êtes affecté par une malédiction modérée ou plus sévère, vous réduisez la sévérité de celle-ci jusqu’à mineure, en plus de regagner un Point de Focalisation.</p>
<p>Faire appel aux pouvoirs de votre mystère alors que votre malédiction est à son pire stade peut causer des conflits irréparables entre vous et les sources de vos pouvoirs. Immédiatement après avoir lancé un sort de révélation alors que vous êtes sous l’effet modéré de votre malédiction, vous êtes Accablé. Quand vous êtes Accablé, vous ne pouvez pas Lancer ni Maintenir un sort de révélation ; concrètement, vous perdez accès à ces sorts. Ces effets persistent jusqu’à ce que vous vous soyez reposé pendant 8 heures et que vous accomplissiez vos préparatifs quotidiens ; à ce moment-là, votre malédiction revient à son état basique. À plus hauts niveaux, vous apprenez à endurer les effets majeurs, voire même extrêmes, de votre malédiction, ce qui vous permet de lancer plus de sorts de révélation sans devenir accablé.</p>
<p>Votre malédiction possède les traits Malédiction, Divin et Nécromancie. Vous ne pouvez ni réduire, ni supprimer, ni atténuer les effets de votre malédiction oraculaire par quelque moyen que ce soit, si ce n’est de Vous Refocaliser ou de vous reposer pendant 8 heures. Par exemple, si votre malédiction fait que certaines créatures sont Masquées à vos yeux, vous ne pouvez pas nier la condition Masqué grâce à un objet magique ou un sort tel que @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Gb7SeieEvd0pL2Eh]{Coup au but} (même si vous pouvez tout de même bénéficier des autres effets du sort ou de l’objet en question). De même, @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.OyFCwQuw8XRazsNr]{Délivrance des malédiction} et les sorts similaires n’ont aucun effet sur votre malédiction.</p>
<h2>Dons d'oracle<span style="float: right;">Niveau 2</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 2 et tous les 2 niveaux, vous obtenez un don de classe d'oracle.</p>
<h2>Dons de compétence<span style="float: right;">Niveau 2</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 2, puis tous les deux niveaux, vous obtenez un don de compétence. Ces dons disposent du trait compétence. Pour choisir un don de compétence, vous devez être au moins qualifié dans la compétence correspondante.</p>
<h2>Dons généraux<span style="float: right;">Niveau 3</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 3, puis tous les quatre niveaux, vous obtenez un don général.</p>
<h2>Sorts emblématiques<span style="float: right;">Niveau 3</span></h2>
<p>L'expérience vous permet de lancer certains de vos sorts avec plus de flexibilité. Pour chaque niveau de sort auquel vous avez accès, choisissez un sort de ce niveau pour en faire un sort emblématique. Vous n’avez pas besoin d’apprendre une à une les versions intensifiées des sorts emblématiques ; à la place, vous pouvez intensifier ces sorts librement. Si vous avez appris un sort emblématique à un niveau supérieur à son niveau minimum, vous pouvez également lancer toutes ses versions de niveau inférieur sans avoir à les apprendre séparément. Si vous remplacez un sort emblématique, vous pouvez l’échanger contre un autre sort emblématique que celui que vous auriez pu apprendre lorsque vous avez appris celui que vous remplacez (par un sort de même niveau ou inférieur). Vous pouvez également suivre un réapprentissage particulier juste pour changer un sort emblématique par un autre de même niveau sans passer par le remplacement ; ceci demande autant de temps que le réapprentissage normal d’un sort.</p>
<h2>Améliorations de compétence<span style="float: right;">Niveau 3</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 3, puis tous les deux niveaux, vous gagnez une amélioration de compétence. Vous pouvez utiliser cette amélioration pour augmenter votre rang de maîtrise et devenir qualifié dans une compétence dans laquelle vous étiez inexpérimenté ou pour améliorer votre rang dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes déjà qualifié pour devenir expert.</p>
<p>À partir du niveau 7, vous pouvez utiliser l’amélioration de compétence pour devenir maître dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes déjà expert et à partir du niveau 15, vous pouvez l’utiliser pour devenir légendaire dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes déjà maître.</p>
<h2>Primes de caractéristiques<span style="float: right;">Niveau 5</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 5, puis tous les cinq niveaux, vous améliorez quatre caractéristiques différentes. Vous pouvez utiliser ces primes de caractéristique pour faire passer une valeur decaractéristique au-dessus de 18. La prime augmente la valeur de caractéristique de 1 si elle est déjà de 18 ou plus ou de 2 si elle est inférieure à 18.</p>
<h2>Dons ancestraux<span style="float: right;">Niveau 5</span></h2>
<p>Vous gagnez un don ancestral au niveau 5 puis tous les quatre niveaux, en plus de celui avec lequel vous avez commencé. La liste des dons se trouve dans la section de votre ascendance, au chapitre 2.</p>
<h2>Incantateur expert<span style="float: right;">Niveau 7</span></h2>
<p>La subtilité de votre puissance divine est devenue plus claire au fil du temps. Vos rangs de maîtrise pour les jets d’attaque de sort occulte et le DD des sorts passent à expert.</p>
<h2>Résolution<span style="float: right;">Niveau 7</span></h2>
<p>Votre résolution cuirasse votre esprit. Votre rang de maîtrise pour les jets de Volonté passe à maître. Quand vous obtenez un succès sur un jet de Volonté, vous remportez à la place un succès critique.</p>
<h2>Vigueur magique<span style="float: right;">Niveau 9</span></h2>
<p>La puissance magique a fortifié la résistance de votre corps. Votre rang de maîtrise pour les jets de Vigueur passe à expert.</p>
<h2>Vigilance<span style="float: right;">Niveau 11</span></h2>
<p>Vous restez à l’affût des menaces alentour. Votre rang de maîtrise en Perception passe à expert.</p>
<h2>Malédiction majeure<span style="float: right;">Niveau 11</span></h2>
<p>Vous avez appris à mieux équilibrer les puissances opposées qui dévastent votre corps. Immédiatement après avoir terminé de lancer un sort de révélation alors que vous êtes affecté par votre malédiction modérée, celle-ci passe à son stade supérieur plutôt que de vous rendre accablé. Cet effet persiste jusqu’à ce que vous vous Refocalisiez, ce qui réduit votre malédiction à son effet mineur. Si vous lancez un sort de révélation alors que vous êtes sous l’effet de votre malédiction majeure, vous devenez accablé par votre malédiction.</p>
<p>De plus, vous augmentez le nombre de Points de Focalisation dans votre réserve de 2 à 3. Si vous dépensez au moins 2 Points de Focalisation avant de Vous Refocaliser, vous récupérez 2 Points de Focalisation au lieu d’un seul en Vous Refocalisant.</p>
<h2>Expertise martiale<span style="float: right;">Niveau 11</span></h2>
<p>Vous vous consacrez à l’apprentissage approfondi du maniement de vos armes. Votre rang de maîtrise avec les armes simples et les attaques à mains nues passe à expert.</p>
<h2>Expertise avec les armures légères<span style="float: right;">Niveau 13</span></h2>
<p>Vous avez appris à esquiver tout en portant une armure légère. Votre rang de maîtrise avec les armures légères et la défense sans armure devient expert.</p>
<h2>Réflexes fulgurants<span style="float: right;">Niveau 13</span></h2>
<p>Vos réflexes sont fulgurants. Votre rang de maîtrise pour les jets de Réflexes passe à expert.</p>
<h2>Spécialisation martiale<span style="float: right;">Niveau 13</span></h2>
<p>Vous pouvez infliger de plus graves blessures avec les armes que vous connaissez le mieux. Vous infligez 2 dégâts de plus avec les armes et les attaques à mains nues pour lesquelles vous êtes expert. Ces dégâts passent à 3 si vous êtes maître et à 4 si vous êtes légendaire.</p>
<h2>Maître incantateur<span style="float: right;">Niveau 15</span></h2>
<p>Vous comprenez véritablement la profondeur et la complexité de la puissance du pouvoir divin de votre mystère. Vos rangs de maîtrise pour les jets d’attaque de sort divins et le DD des sorts divins passent à maître.</p>
<h2>Malédiction extrême<span style="float: right;">Niveau 17</span></h2>
<p>Vous êtes passé maître dans l’art de trouver un équilibre périlleux entre les pouvoirs divins opposés de votre mystère, ce qui vous donne la capacité de changer votre destin mais met à l’épreuve à la fois votre corps et votre âme. Quand vous lancez un sort de révélation alors que vous êtes affecté par votre malédiction majeure, celle-ci s’intensifie jusqu’au stade extrême au lieu de vous accabler. Tous les mystères partagent les mêmes effets pour la malédiction extrême.</p>
<p>Quand vous êtes affecté par la version extrême de votre malédiction, vous êtes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Condamné} 2 (ou augmentez la valeur de votre condition Condamné de 2 si vous êtiez déjà Condamné). Une fois toutes les 10 minutes, si vous ratez un jet d’attaque, de compétence, de Perception ou de sauvegarde, vous pouvez le relancer et utiliser le second résultat. Ce second lancer possède le trait Chance et ne nécessite aucune dépense d’action de votre part, ce qui signifie que vous pouvez utiliser cette seconde chance même quand vous ne pouvez pas agir. Ces effets s’ajoutent à tous les autres effets de votre malédiction majeure, et ils ne peuvent être supprimés d’aucune manière jusqu’à ce que vous @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Vous Refocalisiez} pour réduire votre malédiction à son stade mineur.</p>
<p>Si vous lancez un sort de révélation alors que vous êtes sous l’effet de cette malédiction extrême, vous êtes accablé par votre malédiction et vous restez condamné 2 même si vous Vous Refocalisez.</p>
<p>De plus, si vous dépensez au moins 3 Points de Focalisation avant de Vous Refocaliser, vous récupérez 3 Points de Focalisation au lieu d’un seul quand vous Vous Refocalisez.</p>
<h2>résolution supérieure<span style="float: right;">Niveau 17</span></h2>
<p>Vos entraînements poussés vous ont permis de développer une incroyable résistance mentale. Votre rang de maîtrise des jets de sauvegarde de Volonté devient légendaire. Quand vous obtenez un succès à un jet de Volonté, vous remportez à la place un succès critique. Quand vous obtenez un échec critique à un jet de Volonté, celui-ci se transforme en échec. Lorsque vous obtenez un échec sur le jet de Volonté contre un effet qui vous inflige des dégâts, vous ne subissez que la moitié des dégâts.</p>
<h2>Incantateur légendaire<span style="float: right;">Niveau 19</span></h2>
<p>Vous pouvez exploiter la magie divine à un niveau que peu d'autes atteignent. Vos rangs de maîtrise pour les jets d’attaque de sorts divins le DD des sorts divins passent à légendaire.</p>
<h2>Clarté oraculaire<span style="float: right;">Niveau 19</span></h2>
<p>Vous comprenez désormais complètement la nature des puissances divines liées à votre mystère, ce qui vous permet de produire des effets magiques similaires à des miracles. Ajoutez deux sorts divins courants de niveau 10 à votre répertoire. Vous gagnez un unique emplacement de sort de niveau 10 que vous pouvez utiliser pour lancer l’un de ces deux sorts via votre capacité de lancement de sorts d’oracle.</p>
<p>Contrairement aux autres emplacements de sorts, vous ne gagnez pas plus de sorts de niveau 10 en montant en niveau et vous ne pouvez pas utiliser ces emplacements de sorts de niveau 10 avec des capacités qui vous donnent plus d’emplacements de sorts ou qui vous permettent de lancer des sorts sans dépenser d’emplacement de sorts. Vous pouvez prendre le don @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.PExiZZTSP4p7TZaW]{Providence oraculaire} pour gagner un second emplacement.</p>
