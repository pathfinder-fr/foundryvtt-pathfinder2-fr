Name: Sorcerer
Nom: Ensorceleur
État: officielle

------ Description (en) ------
<p><em>You didn't choose to become a spellcaster-you were born one. There's magic in your blood, whether a divinity touched one of your ancestors, a forebear communed with a primal creature, or a powerful occult ritual influenced your line. Self-reflection and study allow you to refine your inherent magical skills and unlock new, more powerful abilities. The power in your blood carries a risk, however, and you constantly face the choice of whether you'll rise to become a master spellcaster or fall into destruction.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Ability: CHARISMA</strong></p>
<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Charisma.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>
<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>
<h1 class="title">Roleplaying the Sorcerer</h1>
<h2 class="title">During Combat Encounters...</h2>
<p>You use spells to injure your enemies, influence their minds, and hamper their movements. You might be too vulnerable to get into melee combat, or your bloodline might give you abilities that help you hold your own in a brawl. While your magic is powerful, to conserve your best spells-or when you've used them all up-you also rely on cantrips.</p>
<h2 class="title">During Social Encounters...</h2>
<p>Your natural charisma makes you good at interacting with people.</p>
<h2 class="title">While Exploring...</h2>
<p>You detect the magic around you, finding treasures and warning your adventuring group of magical traps. When the group encounters mysteries or problems related to your bloodline, you try to solve them.</p>
<h2 class="title">In Downtime...</h2>
<p>You craft magic items or scribe scrolls. Your bloodline might drive you to research your ancestry or associate with affiliated people or creatures.</p>
<h2 class="title">You Might...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have a strong independent streak, and whether you embrace or reject your magical heritage, you long to distinguish yourself both as a spellcaster and as an individual.</li>
<li>View your lineage with fascination, fear, or something in between-anything from wholehearted acceptance to vehement rejection.</li>
<li>Rely on magic items, such as scrolls and wands, to supplement your limited selection of spells.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="title">Others Probably...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Marvel at your ability to create magic from thin air and view your abilities with equal parts admiration and mistrust.</li>
<li>Consider you less dedicated than studious wizards, devoted clerics, and other practitioners of magic, since power comes to you naturally.</li>
<li>Assume you're as unpredictable as the magic you bring forth, even if your personality proves otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="title">Initial Proficiencies</h1>
<p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way.</p>
<h2 class="title">Perception</h2>
<p>Trained in Perception</p>
<h2 class="title">Saving Throws</h2>
<p>Trained in Fortitude</p>
<p>Trained in Reflex</p>
<p>Expert in Will</p>
<h2 class="title">Skills</h2>
<p>Trained in one or more skills determined by your bloodline</p>
<p>Trained in a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier</p>
<h2 class="title">Attacks</h2>
<p>Trained in simple weapons</p>
<p>Trained in unarmed attacks</p>
<h2 class="title">Defenses</h2>
<p>Untrained in all armor</p>
<p>Trained in unarmored defense</p>
<h2 class="title">Spells</h2>
<p>Trained in spell attack rolls of your spellcasting tradition, as indicated by your bloodline</p>
<p>Trained in spell DCs of your spellcasting tradition, as indicated by your bloodline</p>

<h2 class="title">Ancestry and Background</h2>
<p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>
<h2 class="title">Bloodline</h2>
<p>Choose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent. This choice determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose them from, additional spells you learn, and additional trained skills. You also gain Focus Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline. The bloodlines presented in this book are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.3qqvnC2U8W26yae7]{Aberrant}</strong> A strange and unknowable influence gives you occult spells.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.vhW3glAaEfq2DKrw]{Angelic}</strong> Holy grace bestows divine spells upon you.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.w5koctOVrEcpxTIq]{Demonic}</strong> A sinful corruption gives you divine spells.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.o39zQMIdERWtmBSB]{Diabolic}</strong> A bond with devils gives you divine spells.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ZHabYxSgYK0XbjhM]{Draconic}</strong> The blood of dragons grants you arcane spells.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.RXRnJcG4XSabZ35a]{Elemental}</strong> The power of the elements manifests in you as primal spells.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.eW3cfCH7Wpx2vik2]{Fey}</strong> Influence from the fey gives you primal spells.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.tYOMBiH3HbViNWwn]{Genie}</strong> Through lineage, magic, or wishes made real, the blood of a noble genie flows through your veins.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.O0uXZRWMNliDbkxU]{Hag}</strong> The blight of a hag has given you occult spells.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ZEtJJ5UOlV5oTWWp]{Imperial}</strong> An ancient power grants you arcane spells.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.5Wxjghw7lHuCxjZz]{Nymph}</strong> One of your ancestors was inspired by a nymph, or perhaps was a nymph themself, and now the beauty of nature lives in you.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.PpzH9tJULk5ksX9w]{Psychopomp}</strong> For good or ill, your ancestors' deeds drew the attention of psychopomps, or you might somehow count one in your family tree. The presence of these shepherds of souls and enemies of undeath has left an indelible mark on you.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.uoQOm41BVdSo6pAS]{Shadow}</strong> Whether due to a velstrac's manipulations or a planar jaunt gone horribly wrong, your bloodline was infused with a vein of shadow.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.7WBZ2kkhZ7JorWu2]{Undead}</strong> The touch of death gives you divine spells.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="title">Bloodline Spells</h2>
<p>Your bloodline grants you bloodline spells, special spells unique to your lineage. Bloodline spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity. Unlike other characters, you don't need to do anything specific to Refocus, as the power flowing through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.</p>
<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules can be found here.</p>
<h3>Reading A Bloodline Entry</h3>
<p>A bloodline entry contains the following information:</p>
<p><strong>Spell List</strong> You use this magical tradition and spell list.</p>
<p><strong>Bloodline Skills</strong> You become trained in the listed skills.</p>
<p><strong>Granted Spells</strong> You automatically add the spells listed here to your spell repertoire, as described in the Spell Repertoire class feature. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and a 1st-level spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of that level.</p>
<p><strong>Bloodline Spells</strong> You automatically gain the initial bloodline spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the Advanced Bloodline and Greater Bloodline feats.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Magic</strong> Whenever you cast a bloodline spell using Focus Points or a granted spell from your bloodline using a spell slot, you gain a blood magic effect. If the blood magic offers a choice, make it before resolving the spell. The blood magic effect occurs after resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects and, against a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or the foe fails its saving throw. If the spell has an area, you must designate yourself or one target in the area when you cast the spell to be the target of the blood magic effect. All references to spell level refer to the level of the spell you cast.</p>
<h2 class="title">Initial Proficiencies</h2>
<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.</p>
<h2 class="title">Sorcerer Spellcasting</h2>
<p>Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch.</p>
<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>
<p>As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3-17: Sorcerer Spells per Day.</p>
<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>
<h3 class="title"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>
<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>
<h3 class="title"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>
<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a sorcerer. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>

<h2 class="title">Spell Repertoire</h2>
<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.</p>
<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3-17), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. When you gain access to a new level of spells, your first new spell is always your bloodline spell, but you can choose the other spells you gain. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new bloodline spell and two other 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-level version of a spell you already have so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>
<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>
<h3 class="title">Swapping Spells in your Repertoire</h3>
<p>As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>
<h2 class="title">Skill Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 2</span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>
<h2 class="title">Sorcerer Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 2</span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a sorcerer class feat.</p>
<h2 class="title">General Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>
<h2 class="title">Signature Spells<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>You've learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>
<h2 class="title">Skill Increases<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>
<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>
<h2 class="title">Ability Boosts<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>
<h2 class="title">Ancestry Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
<h2 class="title">Magical Fortitude<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Expert Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 7</span></h2>
<p>Your inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Lightning Reflexes<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Alertness<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Weapon Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>You've improved your combat skill. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Defensive Robes<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>The flow of magic and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Weapon Specialization<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>You've learned to inflict grave wounds with your most practiced weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>
<h2 class="title">Master Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 15</span></h2>
<p>You have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to master.</p>
<h2 class="title">Resolve<span style="float: right;">Level 17</span></h2>
<p>You've steeled you mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increase to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>
<h2 class="title">Bloodline Paragon<span style="float: right;">Level 19</span></h2>
<p>You have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-level spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, and they can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.6SEDoht4dXEJE5SW]{Bloodline Perfection} sorcerer feat to gain a second slot.</p>
<h2 class="title">Legendary Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 19</span></h2>
<p>You demonstrate prodigious talent for spellcasting. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to legendary.</p>
------ Description (fr) ------
<p><em>Vous n’avez pas choisi de devenir un lanceur de sorts — vous êtes né ainsi. La magie coule dans vos veines, peut-être parce qu’une divinité a béni l’un de vos ancêtres, parce qu’un ancien membre de votre famille a communié avec une créature primordiale ou parce qu’un puissant rituel occulte a influencé votre lignée. L’introspection et l’étude vous permettent d’affiner vos compétences magiques inhérentes et de développer de nouveaux pouvoirs plus puissants. Le pouvoir qui imprègne votre sang comporte pourtant un risque et vous devez constamment faire des choix dont les conséquences vous élèveront au rang de lanceur de sorts émérite ou causeront votre destruction.</em></p>
<p><strong>Caractéristique essentielle: CHARISME</strong></p>
<p>Au niveau 1, votre classe vous donne une prime de caractéristique au Charisme.</p>
<p><strong>Points de vie : 6 plus votre modificateur de Constitution</p>
<p>Vous augmentez votre maximum de PV de ce montant au niveau 1, puis à chaque fois que vous gagnez un niveau.</p>
<h1 class="title">Jouer un ensorceleur</h1>
<h2 class="title">Lors des rencontres de combat...</h2>
<p>Vous utilisez vos sorts pour blesser vos ennemis, influencer leur esprit et gêner leurs mouvements. Vous pouvez vous sentir vulnérable dans un combat rapproché, mais votre lignage peut aussi vous conférer des pouvoirs qui permettent de vous défendre dans une telle situation. Votre magie est puissante, mais pour conserver vos sorts les plus efficaces ou si vous les avez tous utilisés, vous pouvez également compter sur vos tours de magie.</p>
<h2 class="title">Lors des rencontres sociales...</h2>
<p>Votre charisme naturel vous permet d'avoir de bonnes interactions sociales.</p>
<h2 class="title">En exploration...</h2>
<p>Vous détectez la magie autour de vous, en dénichant les trésors et en avertissant les autres aventuriers de votre groupe de la présence de pièges magiques. Quand votre groupe tombe sur des mystères ou des problèmes en rapport avec votre lignage, vous tentez de les résoudre.</p>
<h2 class="title">Pendant un intermède...</h2>
<p>Vous fabriquez des objets magiques ou écrivez des parchemins. Votre lignage peut vous pousser à faire des recherches sur votre ascendance ou à vous associer à des gens ou des créatures affiliés.</p>
<h2 class="title">Vous...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Êtes souvent très indépendant et, que vous repoussiez ou acceptiez votre héritage magique, vous faites ce qu’il faut pour vous distinguer en tant que lanceur de sorts mais aussi en tant qu’individu.</li>
<li>Êtes fasciné, terrorisé ou les deux à la fois, par votre lignage. Vous pouvez ainsi l’accepter sans réserve ou le rejeter avec véhémence.</li>
<li>Comptez sur l’utilisation d’objets magiques, tels que les parchemins et les baguettes, pour compléter votre sélection limitée de sorts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="title">Les autres...</h2>
<ul>
<li>S’émerveillent de votre capacité à faire de la magie à partir de rien et voient vos pouvoirs avec méfiance autant qu'admiration.</li>
<li>Vous considèrent comme moins investi que les magiciens studieux, les prêtres dévoués ou d’autres utilisateurs de magie, car vos pouvoirs vous viennent naturellement.</li>
<li>Partent du principe que vous êtes aussi imprévisible que la magie que vous pratiquez, même si votre personnalité prouve le contraire.</li>

<h2 class="title">Ascendance et historique</h2>
<p>En plus des pouvoirs que votre classe vous accorde au niveau 1, vous bénéficiez des avantages de votre ascendance et de votre historique.</p>
<h2 class="title">Lignage</h2>
<p>Choisissez un lignage qui vous confère votre talent d’incantation. Ce choix détermine le type de sorts que vous lancez et la liste de sorts que vous utilisez pour les sélectionner, les sorts supplémentaires que vous apprenez et les compétences supplémentaires dans lesquelles vous êtes qualifié. Vous obtenez également des points de focalisation et des sorts focalisés spéciaux déterminés par votre lignage. Voici les différents lignages.</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.vhW3glAaEfq2DKrw]{Angélique}</strong> la grâce divine vous accorde des sorts divins.</li>

<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ZEtJJ5UOlV5oTWWp]{Impérial}</strong> une puissance ancienne vous octroie des sorts arcaniques.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.7WBZ2kkhZ7JorWu2]{Mort-vivant}</strong> le contact de la mort vous confère des sorts divins.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.5Wxjghw7lHuCxjZz]{Nymphe}</strong> l'influence des nymphes vous confère des sorts primordiaux.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.uoQOm41BVdSo6pAS]{Ombre}</strong> l'influence du plan de l'Ombre vous confère des sorts occultes.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.TWR1wbPJuCLnGdFZ]{Phénix}</strong> l'influence du phénix vous confère des sorts primordiaux.</li>
<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.PpzH9tJULk5ksX9w]{Psychopompe}</strong> l'influence des psychopompes vous confère des sorts divins.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="title">Sorts de lignage</h2>
<p>Votre lignage vous confère des sorts de lignage, des sorts spéciaux et propres à votre lignage. Les sorts de lignage forment un type particulier de sorts focalisés. Il faut dépenser 1 point de focalisation pour lancer un sort focalisé et vous commencez avec une réserve de focalisation de 1 point. Elle se remplit lors de vos préparatifs quotidiens et vous pouvez récupérer 1 point de focalisation en utilisant l’activité Refocaliser pendant dix minutes. À la différence des autres personnages, vous n’avez pas besoin de vous consacrez à une activité particulière quand vous vous Refocalisez car le pouvoir qui coule dans vos veines renfloue naturellement votre réserve de focalisation.</p>
<p>Un sort focalisé est automatiquement intensifié à la moitié de votre niveau arrondi à l’entier supérieur. Un sort focalisé n’a pas besoin d’emplacement de sort et vous ne pouvez pas utiliser un tel emplacement pour le lancer. Certains dons accordent d’autres sorts focalisés et augmentent la taille de votre réserve de focalisation, bien que cette dernière ne puisse jamais contenir plus de 3 points.</p>
<h3>Description d'un lignage</h3>
<p>Chaque section décrivant un lignage contient les informations suivantes :</p>
<p><strong>Liste de sorts</strong> Vous utilisez cette tradition magique et la liste de sorts correspondante.</p>
<p><strong>Compétences de lignage</strong> Vous devenez qualifié avec les compétences indiquées.</p>
<p><strong>Sorts accordés</strong> Vous ajoutez obligatoirement les sorts indiqués ici à votre répertoire de sorts, avant de le compléter avec ceux que vous gagnez grâce à votre capacité d'incantation d'ensorceleur. Au niveau 1, vous obtenez un tour de magie et un sort de niveau 1. Vous apprenez les autres sorts de la liste dès qu’il vous est possible de lancer des sorts d’ensorceleur du niveau indiqué.</p>
<p><strong>Sorts de lignage</strong> Vous gagnez automatiquement le sort de lignage initial au niveau 1 et vous pouvez en obtenir davantage en prenant les dons Lignage avancé et Lignage supérieur.</p>
<p><strong>Magie du sang</strong> Dès que vous lancez un sort de lignage en utilisant des points de focalisation ou un sort accordé par votre lignage en utilisant un emplacement de sort, vous produisez un effet de magie du sang. Si la magie du sang vous propose de faire un choix, faites-le avant de résoudre le sort. L’effet de magie du sang se produit après les tests nécessaires pour résoudre les effets initiaux du sort. Contre un adversaire, il s’applique uniquement si le sort est une attaque réussie ou si l’adversaire rate son jet de sauvegarde. Si le sort produit une zone, vous devez vous désigner vous-même ou une cible dans la zone quand vous lancez le sort ; la créature désignée est la cible de l’effet de magie du sang. Toute référence au niveau du sort concerne le niveau du sort que vous lancez.</p>
<h2 class="title">Maîtrises initiales</h2>
<p>Au niveau 1, vous obtenez un nombre de maîtrises qui représentent votre entraînement de base. Elles sont indiquées au début de cette classe.</p>
<h2 class="title">Incantation de l'ensorceleur</h2>
<p>Votre lignage vous confère d’incroyables capacités magiques. Vous lancez des sorts avec l’activité Lancer un sort et pouvez fournir des composants matériels, somatiques et verbaux lors de l’incantation. Étant donné que vous êtes un ensorceleur, vous pouvez le plus souvent remplacer les composants matériels par des composants somatiques et vous n’avez donc pas besoin d’une bourse de composants.</p>
<p>Vous pouvez lancer jusqu’à trois sorts de niveau 1 par jour. Vous devez connaître ces sorts pour les lancer et vous les apprenez grâce à la capacité de classe Répertoire de sorts. Le nombre de sorts que vous pouvez préparer chaque jour est représenté par vos emplacements de sort.</p>
<p>En gagnant des niveaux en tant qu’ensorceleur, le nombre de sorts, ainsi que le niveau de sorts le plus élevé, que vous pouvez lancer quotidiennement augmentent, comme indiqué dans le tableau des Sorts d’ensorceleur quotidiens.</p>
<p>Certains sorts exigent un jet d’attaque de sort pour déterminer leur efficacité ou obligent vos ennemis à faire un jet contre leur DD (en général un jet de sauvegarde). Comme le Charisme est votre caractéristique essentielle, vos jets d’attaque de sort et vos DD utilisent votre modificateur de Charisme.</p>
<h3 class="title"><strong>Les sorts intensifiés</strong></h3>
<p>Quand vous obtenez des emplacements de sort de niveau 2 et plus, vous pouvez les remplir avec des versions plus puissantes de sorts de niveau inférieur. Ceci augmente le niveau du sort pour qu’il corresponde à celui de l’emplacement. Vous devez avoir, dans votre répertoire de sorts, un sort au niveau où vous souhaitez le lancer pour pouvoir l’intensifier de cette façon. Nombre de sorts possèdent des améliorations spécifiques quand ils sont intensifiés à un niveau donné. La capacité de classe sorts emblématiques vous permet d’intensifier certains sorts sans prendre en compte ces restrictions.</p>
<h3 class="title"><strong>Les tours de magie</strong></h3>
<p>Un tour de magie est un type de sort qui n’utilise pas d’emplacement de sort. Il se lance à volonté chaque jour, aussi souvent que vous le désirez. Un tour de magie est toujours automatiquement intensifié jusqu’à la moitié de votre niveau arrondi à l’entier supérieur, donc généralement égal au sort de plus haut niveau que vous pouvez lancer en tant qu’ensorceleur. Par exemple, les tours de magie d’un ensorceleur de niveau 1 sont de niveau 1, tandis que ceux d’un ensorceleur de niveau 5 sont de niveau 3.</p>
<h2 class="title">Répertoire de sorts</h2>
<p>L'ensemble des sorts que vous savez lancer constitue votre répertoire de sorts. Au niveau 1, vous apprenez deux sorts de niveau 1 et quatre tours de magie que vous choisissez ainsi qu’un sort et un tour de magie supplémentaires conférés par votre lignage. Vous les choisissez dans la liste des sorts courants de la tradition correspondant à votre lignage ou parmi les autres sorts de cette tradition auxquels vous avez accès. Vous pouvez lancer un sort de votre répertoire en utilisant un emplacement de sort du niveau correspondant.</p>
<p>Vous ajoutez des sorts à votre répertoire au fur et à mesure que vous gagnez des niveaux. Chaque fois que vous obtenez un emplacement de sort (voir le tableau ci-dessous), vous ajoutez un sort du même niveau dans votre répertoire. Quand vous avez accès à un nouveau niveau de sorts, votre premier sort de ce niveau est toujours celui conféré par votre lignage, mais vous pouvez choisir les autres sorts que vous obtenez. Au niveau 2, vous choisissez un autre sort de niveau 1 ; au niveau 3, vous obtenez un nouveau sort de lignage et deux autres sorts de niveau 2, etc. Quand vous ajoutez des sorts, vous pouvez choisir la version de niveau supérieur d’un sort que vous connaissez déjà afin de pouvoir lancer une version intensifiée de ce sort.</p>
<p>Même si vous les obtenez au même rythme, vos emplacements de sort et les sorts dans votre répertoire sont deux choses distinctes. Si un don ou une autre capacité vous permet d’ajouter un sort à votre répertoire, cela ne vous donne pas pour autant un nouvel emplacement de sort, et vice versa.</p>
<h3 class="title">Remplacer des sorts de votre répertoire</h3>
<p>Lorsque vous ajoutez de nouveaux sorts dans votre répertoire, vous avez la possibilité de remplacer certains de ceux que vous connaissez déjà. Chaque fois que vous gagnez un niveau et que vous apprenez des sorts nouveaux, vous pouvez remplacer un de vos anciens sorts par un sort différent du même niveau. Ce sort peut être un tour de magie mais vous ne pouvez pas remplacer vos sorts de lignage. Vous pouvez également remplacer des sorts grâce au réapprentissage durant les intermèdes.</p>

<h2 class="title">Dons de compétences<span style="float: right;">Niveau 2</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 2, puis tous les deux niveaux, vous gagnez un don de compétence. Ces dons ont le trait compétence. Pour choisir un don de compétence, vous devez être au moins qualifié dans la compétence correspondante.</p>
<h2 class="title">Dons d'ensorceleur<span style="float: right;">Niveau 2</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 2, puis tous les niveaux pairs, vous gagnez un don de classe d’ensorceleur.</p>
<h2 class="title">Dons généraux<span style="float: right;">Niveau 3</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 3, puis tous les quatre niveaux, vous gagnez un don général.</p>
<h2 class="title">Sorts emblématiques<span style="float: right;">Niveau 3</span></h2>
<p>Vous avez appris à lancer certains de vos sorts avec plus de flexibilité. Pour chaque niveau de sort auquel vous avez accès, choisissez un sort de ce niveau pour en faire un sort emblématique. Vous n’avez pas besoin d’apprendre une à une les versions intensifiées des sorts emblématiques ; en fait, vous pouvez intensifier sans contrainte ces sorts. Si vous connaissez un sort emblématique à un niveau supérieur à son niveau minimum, vous pouvez également lancer toutes ses versions de niveau inférieur sans avoir à les apprendre séparément. Si vous remplacez un sort emblématique, vous pouvez l’échanger contre un autre sort emblématique de même niveau que celui auquel vous avez appris celui que vous remplacez. Vous pouvez également suivre un réapprentissage juste pour changer un sort emblématique par un autre de même niveau sans passer par le remplacement ; ceci demande autant de temps que le réapprentissage normal d’un sort.</p>
<h2 class="title">Améliorations de compétence<span style="float: right;">Niveau 3</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 3, puis tous les deux niveaux, vous gagnez une amélioration de compétence. Vous pouvez utiliser cette amélioration pour augmenter votre rang de maîtrise et devenir qualifié dans une compétence dans laquelle vous étiez inexpérimenté ou pour améliorer votre rang dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes déjà qualifié pour devenir expert.</p>
<p>À partir du niveau 7, vous pouvez utiliser l’amélioration de compétence pour devenir maître dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes déjà expert et à partir du niveau 15, vous pouvez l’utiliser pour devenir légendaire dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes déjà maître.</p>
<h2 class="title">Primes de caractéristiques<span style="float: right;">Niveau 5</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 5, puis tous les cinq niveaux, vous améliorez quatre caractéristiques différentes. Vous pouvez utiliser ces primes de caractéristique pour faire passer une valeur de caractéristique au-dessus de 18. La prime augmente la valeur de caractéristique de 1 si elle est déjà de 18 ou plus ou de 2 si elle est inférieure à 18.</p>
<h2 class="title">Dons ancestraux<span style="float: right;">Niveau 5</span></h2>
<p>Vous gagnez un don ancestral au niveau 5 puis tous les quatre niveaux, en plus de celui avec lequel vous avez commencé.</p>
<h2 class="title">Vigueur magique<span style="float: right;">Niveau 5</span></h2>
<p>La puissance magique a amélioré la résilience de votre corps. Votre rang de maîtrise pour les jets de Vigueur passe à expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Incantateur expert<span style="float: right;">Niveau 7</span></h2>
<p>Votre magie intrinsèque répond facilement et puissamment à vos sollicitations. Votre rang de maîtrise pour les jets d’attaque de sort et le DD des sorts de la tradition de votre lignage passe à expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Réflexes fulgurants<span style="float: right;">Niveau 9</span></h2>
<p>Vos réflexes sont fulgurants. Votre rang de maîtrise pour les jets de Réflexes passe à expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Vigilance<span style="float: right;">Niveau 11</span></h2>
<p>Vous restez à l’affût des menaces alentour. Votre rang de maîtrise en Perception passe à expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Expertise avec les armes simples<span style="float: right;">Niveau 11</span></h2>
<p>L’entraînement et la magie améliorent votre technique de maniement des armes. Votre rang de maîtrise avec les armes simples et les attaques à mains nues passe à expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Robes défensives<span style="float: right;">Niveau 13</span></h2>
<p>Vous savez mieux esquiver les coups grâce au flux magique et à votre entraînement en matière de défense. Votre rang de maîtrise pour la défense sans armure passe à expert.</p>
<h2 class="title">Spécialisation martiale<span style="float: right;">Niveau 13</span></h2>
<p>Vous avez appris à infliger des blessures graves avec les armes que vous savez manier. Vous infligez 2 dégâts supplémentaires avec les armes et les attaques à mains nues pour lesquelles vous êtes expert. Ces dégâts passent à 3 si vous êtes maître et à 4 si vous êtes légendaire.</p>
<h2 class="title">Maître incantateur<span style="float: right;">Niveau 15</span></h2>
<p>Vous maîtrisez la magie qui imprègne votre sang. Votre rang de maîtrise pour les jets d’attaque de sort et le DD des sorts de la tradition de votre lignage passe à maître.</p>
<h2 class="title">Résolution<span style="float: right;">Niveau 17</span></h2>
<p>Votre résolution raffermit votre esprit. Vous accédez au rang de maître pour les jets de Volonté. Lorsque vous obtenez un succès sur un jet de Volonté, vous le remplacez par un succès critique.</p>
<h2 class="title">Parangon du lignage<span style="float: right;">Niveau 19</span></h2>
<p>Vous maîtrisez à présent parfaitement la magie de votre lignage. Ajoutez deux sorts communs de niveau 10 de votre tradition à votre répertoire. Vous gagnez un unique emplacement de sort de niveau 10 que vous pouvez utiliser pour lancer l’un de ces deux sorts avec la capacité d’incantation de l’ensorceleur. Au contraire des autres emplacements de sort, vous ne gagnez pas plus de sorts de niveau 10 lorsque vous montez de niveaux et vous ne pouvez pas les utiliser avec des capacités qui vous permettent de lancer des sorts sans dépenser d’emplacements ou avec des pouvoirs qui vous procurent davantage d’emplacements de sort. Vous pouvez prendre le don d’ensorceleur Perfection du lignage pour gagner un deuxième emplacement.</p>
<h2 class="title">Incantateur légendaire<span style="float: right;">Niveau 19</span></h2>
<p>Votre talent en matière d’incantation est prodigieux. Votre rang de maîtrise pour les jets d’attaque de sort et le DD des sorts de la tradition de votre lignage passe à légendaire.</p>
