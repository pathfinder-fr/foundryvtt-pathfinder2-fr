You're always on the verge of the next great breakthrough, and every trial and tribulation is another opportunity to test and tune. If you can dream it, you can build it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Ability: INTELLIGENCE</strong></p>
<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>
<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>
<h1>Roleplaying the Inventor</h1>
<h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2>
<p>You rely on your inventions as much as possible, testing their functionalities under a variety of conditions. You don't set out to achieve anything as banal as simply winning a fight; you seek to collect valuable data that can be used to improve your creations!</p>
<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>
<p>You provide useful context when discussing a variety of academic topics, particularly when speaking about those subjects related to crafting and invention. You might often look for opportunities to acquire patronage to fund some of your more expensive or unorthodox experiments. After all, the materials needed to assemble your inventions don't pay for themselves!</p>
<h2>While Exploring...</h2>
<p>You study the design and construction of the environments you explore ardently, making note of clever traps, ingenious mechanisms, or especially keen architecture you come across for later.</p>
<h2>In Downtime...</h2>
<p>You brainstorm new designs, bringing them to fruition through careful crafting and meticulous attention to detail. You might also modify previous inventions to adjust for data you've collected in the field. You might work as a local smith or tinker where your skills are needed, or you might keep a workshop on the edge of town where the clank and clatter of your experiments attracts less attention.</p>
<h2>You Might...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy creating new things the world has never seen before.</li>
<li>Be willing to take a chance on a theory, testing to see if your hypothesis proves accurate. If not, you probably record the results to try again later.</li>
<li>Wear clothes spattered with oil and grime, or venture off on excited and technical tangents when asked simple questions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Others Probably...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Marvel at your inventions and the variety of unbelievable wonder they can bring.</li>
<li>Believe that you're a genius whose work is beyond understanding.</li>
<li>Worry that your inventions might backfire or explode.</li>

<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>
<p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>
<h2>Overdrive</h2>
<p>You have a bevy of smaller devices of your own invention, from muscle stimulants to concussive pistons. When it's necessary, you can throw them into overdrive to assist you in combat.</p>
<h2>Innovation</h2>
<p>While you're always creating inventions, there's one that represents your preeminent work, the one that you hope- with refinement-might change the world. Choose one of the below innovations. Your innovation's level is equal to your level. If your innovation is destroyed, you can spend 1 day of downtime and attempt a Crafting check with a high DC for your level; on a success, you rebuild it. An innovation only works due to your constant maintenance and tinkering, and therefore has no market Price.</p>
<p>The innovations you can choose from in this book are as follows.</p>
<h3>Armor</h3>
<p>Your innovation is a cutting-edge suit of medium armor with a variety of attached gizmos and devices. Choose one of the sets of statistics on Table 2-2: Innovation Armor Statistics for your innovation armor (or choose another set of innovation armor statistics to which you have access).</p>
<p>Your innovation armor can have fundamental and property runes added to it in the same way as ordinary armor. Because of the unique features of your innovation, everyone except you is untrained in it, even if they would normally be trained (or better) in medium armor. Choose one initial armor modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial armor modifications to which you have access.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Harmonic Oscillator</strong> You designed your armor to inaudibly thrum at just the right frequency to create interference against force and sound waves. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to force and sonic damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li>
<li><strong>Metallic Reactance</strong> The metals in your armor are carefully alloyed to ground electricity and protect from acidic chemical reactions. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to acid and electricity damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li>
<li><strong>Muscular Exoskeleton (Power Suit Only)</strong> Your armor supports your muscles with a carefully crafted exoskeleton. When you send your armor into overdrive, the exoskeleton supplements your feats of athletics as well. When under the effects of Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks; if you're a master in Crafting, this increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.</li>
<li><strong>Otherworldly Protection</strong> Just because you use science doesn't mean you can't build your armor with carefully chosen materials and gizmos designed to protect against otherworldly attacks. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to negative damage, or to positive damage if you have negative healing (such as if you're a dhampir). You gain the same amount of resistance to any types of alignment damage-good, evil, chaotic, lawful-that can damage you (note that creatures don't take a given type of alignment damage unless they are of the opposing alignment; for instance, you can take evil damage only if you are good in alignment).</li>
<li><strong>Phlogistonic Regulator</strong> A layer of insulation within your armor protects you from rapid temperature fluctuations. You gain resistance equal to half your level to cold and fire damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li>
<li><strong>Speed Boosters</strong> You have boosters in your armor that increase your Speed. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed, which increases to a +10-foot status bonus when under the effects of Overdrive.</li>
<li><strong>Subtle Dampeners (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've designed your armor to help you blend in and dampen noise slightly. When you send your armor into overdrive, the dampeners increase their effect, improving your Stealth. When under the effects of Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks. If you're a master in Crafting, this increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.</li>

<h3>Construct</h3>
<p>Your innovation is a mechanical creature, such as a clockwork construct made of cogs and gears. It's a prototype construct companion, and you can adjust most of its base statistics by taking feats at higher levels, such as Advanced Companion. If you use the Overdrive action, your construct gains the same Overdrive benefits you do, and it also takes the same amount of fire damage on a critical failure.</p>
<p>You know how to spend additional time directing, controlling, or programming your construct innovation for a more complex plan of action. You can spend 2 actions to Command instead of 1 when commanding your construct companion; your construct companion can then use an additional action (normally 3 actions, rather than 2).</p>
<p>Choose one initial construct modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial construct modifications to which you have access. These modifications alter the construct's abilities or form.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accelerated Mobility</strong> Actuated legs, efficient gears in the wheels or treads, or add-on boosters make your construct faster. Your innovation's Speed increases to 40 feet.</li>
<li><strong>Amphibious Construction</strong> Increased buoyancy, rudders, and a means of propulsion like a fluked tail or powerful propeller make your construct able to travel in water. Your innovation gains a swim Speed of 25 feet.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Size</strong> You built your construct innovation bigger than most. Your construct is Large. If you have this modification and your construct innovation becomes an advanced construct companion or otherwise gains the ability to become Large, you can immediately change increased size to a different initial construct modification.</li>
<li><strong>Manual Dexterity</strong> Your construct innovation has articulated hands or similar appendages with significant manual dexterity. It can perform manipulate actions with up to two of its limbs. As normal for a companion, it still can't wield weapons or held items that don't have the companion trait, and it can't activate items.</li>
<li><strong>Projectile Launcher</strong> Your construct has a mounted dart launcher, embedded cannon, or similar armament. Your innovation gains a ranged unarmed attack that deals 1d4 bludgeoning or piercing damage (you choose when you pick this modification). The attack has the propulsive trait and a range increment of 30 feet.</li>
<li><strong>Sensory Array</strong> Additional sensory devices give your innovation low-light vision and darkvision, as well as imprecise tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.</li>
<li><strong>Wonder Gears</strong> You map specialized skills into your construct's crude intelligence. Your innovation becomes trained in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weapon</h3>
<p>Your innovation is an impossible-looking weapon augmented by numerous unusual mechanisms. It begins with the same statistics as a level 0 common simple or martial weapon of your choice, or another level 0 simple or martial weapon to which you have access. You can instead use the statistics of a 1st-level common simple or martial weapon of your choice, or another 1st-level simple or martial weapon to which you have access, but you must pay the monetary Price for the weapon. An innovation weapon can have fundamental and property runes added to it in the same way as an ordinary weapon. Because of the unique features of your innovation, everyone except you is untrained in it, even if they would normally be trained (or better) in simple or martial weapons. If you use the Overdrive action, you can choose to change the additional damage from Overdrive to fire damage. Choose one initial weapon modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial weapon modifications to which you have access. These modifications grant additional weapon traits, sometimes with extra abilities. A modification might give your weapon the versatile trait with a damage type that the weapon could already deal, either from its base damage type or from an existing versatile trait. In that case, if you select that modification, you can instead choose to give the weapon the versatile trait for a different damage type: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blunt Shot (Ranged Only)</strong> Your weapon innovation can file the edges off your ammunition and adjust the blunt force of the shot to deliver a bludgeoning attack when necessary, as well as to avoid striking a lethal blow with an otherwise deadly shot. Your innovation gains the nonlethal and versatile B traits. You can choose whether to apply the nonlethal trait on each attack with your innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Complex Simplicity (Simple Weapon Only)</strong> Increase your innovation's weapon damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). In addition, it gains one of the following traits of your choice: versatile B, versatile P, or versatile S.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Weighting (One-handed Melee Weapon Only; Can't Have the Agile, Attached, or Free-hand Trait)</strong> Your weapon's modified weight distribution can increase power in exchange for taking more hands to wield. Your innovation gains the two-hand trait, with a damage die one size higher than the weapon's normal weapon damage die size (for instance, a longsword would gain the two-hand d10 trait). Your innovation also gains the versatile B trait.</li>
<li><strong>Entangling Form (Melee Only)</strong> You've altered your weapon to including tangling wires or straps, or to have a flexible construction. Your innovation gains the grapple and trip traits.</li>
<li><strong>Hampering Spikes (Melee Only)</strong> You've added long, snagging spikes to your weapon, which you can use to impede your foes' movement. Your innovation gains the hampering and versatile P traits.</li>
<li><strong>Hefty Composition (Melee Only)</strong> Blunt surfaces and sturdy construction make your weapon hefty and mace-like. Your innovation gains the shove and versatile B traits.</li>
<li><strong>Modular Head</strong> You've constructed a multi-purpose, adjustable striking surface for your weapon, or you've made special ammunition you can swiftly alter. Your innovation gains the modular trait for bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. When you Interact to use the modular trait, you can also choose to give the weapon the nonlethal trait if it doesn't currently have it, or to remove that trait if it's currently nonlethal.</li>
<li><strong>Pacification Tools (Melee Only)</strong> Softer materials make your weapon suited to knock out instead of kill, and special protrusions let you catch weapons and disarm your foes. Your innovation gains the disarm and nonlethal traits. You can choose whether to apply the nonlethal trait on each attack with your innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Razor Prongs (Melee Only)</strong> You can knock down and slash your foes with sharp, curved blades added to your weapon. Your innovation gains the trip and versatile S traits.</li>
<li><strong>Segmented Frame</strong> Hinges, clamps, and telescoping parts make your innovation collapsible and adjustable. It gains the modular trait for bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. You can Interact to collapse the item down to light Bulk or to return it to your normal form. When it's collapsed to light Bulk, it has the concealable trait, which grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks and DCs to hide or conceal the weapon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Explode</h2>
<p>Your innovation is a creation barely held together by your own engineering, always on the edge of completely falling apart. Though this adds risk, it also means you can coax it to perform far beyond its design specifications using special unstable actions. See the definition of the unstable trait and how it affects your innovation.</p>
<p>While inventors can learn various unstable actions over their career, all at least know how to make their innovation Explode.</p>
<h2>Peerless Inventor</h2>
<p>You are constantly inventing, and your skill at crafting is unimpeachable. You gain the Inventor skill feat, even if you don't meet its prerequisites.</p>
<h2>Shield Block</h2>
<p>You gain the Shield Block general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.</p>
<h2>Inventor Feats</h2>
<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an inventor class feat. Some features and feats use an assortment of gizmos you keep on your person. For simplicity, these are left abstract, but if you are deprived of your gear for some reason, you might lose access to many feats and features, subject to GM discretion.</p>
<h2>Skill Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 2</span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>
<h2>Expert Overdrive<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>You've increased your skill in crafting, and you can put your devices into a more powerful state of overdrive. You become an expert in Crafting, and on a successful use of Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by 1.</p>
<h2>General Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>
<h2>Reconfigure<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>You've become an expert in all crafts and are always adjusting your inventions. You can attempt to change the modifications on your innovation by spending 1 day of downtime tinkering with it and attempting a Crafting check, with a high DC for your level. On a success, you can change one modification you've chosen for your innovation to a different modification of the same kind (initial, breakthrough, or revolutionary).</p>
<p>If you have any modification feats, on a successful check you can choose to instead retrain a modification feat to a different modification feat. The new feat has to meet the standard restrictions for retraining.</p>
<h2>Skill Increases<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>
<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>
<h2>Ability Boosts<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>
<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
<h2>Inventor Weapon Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>You develop tricks for using your weapons more effectively. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>
<p>If you have a weapon innovation, you gain access to the critical specialization effect with your innovation.</p>
<h2>Breakthrough Innovation<span style="float: right;">Level 7</span></h2>
<p>You've made a breakthrough in your field of study and discovered a powerful new way to enhance your innovation. Choose a breakthrough modification of your innovation's type to apply to your innovation. You can choose an initial modification of your innovation's type instead if you prefer.</p>
<h3>Breakthrough Armor Modifications</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Antimagic Plating</strong> Whether you used some clever adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal known as noqual or created magical protections of your own design, you've strengthened your armor against magic. While wearing the armor, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all saving throws against spells and to AC against spells. Against spells that target the armor directly (like heat metal), you instead gain a +4 circumstance bonus to all saving throws and to AC.</li>
<li><strong>Camouflage Pigmentation (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've modified your armor's exterior to let you blend into your surroundings with ease, as long as you stay still. While wearing your armor, you can Hide even without cover or concealment, as the pigmentation shifts to match your surroundings.</li>
<li><strong>Dense Plating</strong> You have encased your armor in robust plating. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to slashing damage equal to half your level.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Resistance</strong> You've improved upon your initial modification's ability to resist damage. The resistance from your initial armor modification adds your full level, instead of half your level (for instance, phlogistonic regulator's resistance would increase to your level). If you have more than one initial modification that gives resistance, choose which one this applies to.</li>
<li><strong>Heavy Construction (Power Suit Only)</strong> You've expanded your innovation into a heavy bulwark, and your groundbreaking design ensures you don't take any of the drawbacks for such heavy defenses. Your innovation becomes heavy armor, and your proficiency in your innovation armor (but no other heavy armor) advances to be equal to your proficiency in medium armor. If your Strength score is at least 16, you remove the Speed penalty entirely instead of reducing it to -5 feet. The armor's adjusted statistics are: AC Bonus +5; Dex Cap +1; Check Penalty -2; Speed Penalty -10 feet; Strength 16; Bulk 3; Group composite; Armor Traits bulwark.</li>
<li><strong>Hyper Boosters</strong> You've improved your speed boosters' power through a breakthrough that significantly increases the energy flow without risking exploding. You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed, which increases to a +20-foot status bonus when you're in Overdrive. If you're legendary in Crafting, it instead increases to a +30-foot status bonus when you're in Overdrive. You must have the speed boosters modification to select this modification.</li>
<li><strong>Layered Mesh</strong> You've woven an incredibly powerful network of interlocking mesh around your armor, which catches piercing attacks and diffuses them. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to piercing damage equal to half your level.</li>
<li><strong>Tensile Absorption</strong> You've enhanced the tensile capabilities of your armor, enabling it to bend with bludgeoning attacks. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to half your level.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Breakthrough Construct Modifications</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advanced Weaponry</strong> You've powered up your construct's weaponry. Choose one of your construct's unarmed attacks to gain your choice of one initial weapon modification, chosen from the list on page 18 or from other initial weapon modifications to which you have access. The unarmed attack must meet any requirements for the chosen traits (such as being a melee attack for entangling form), and since it's an unarmed attack, it can never meet certain requirements, such as being a simple weapon for complex simplicity.</li>
<li><strong>Antimagic Construction</strong> Whether you used some clever adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal known as noqual or created magical protections entirely of your own devising, you've made your innovation highly resilient to spells. Your construct innovation gains a +2 circumstance bonus to all saving throws and AC against spells.</li>
<li><strong>Climbing Limbs</strong> With appendages that can claw or create suction, your construct becomes a capable climber. Your innovation gains a climb Speed equal to half its land Speed.</li>
<li><strong>Durable Construction</strong> Your innovation is solidly built; it can take significant punishment before being destroyed. Increase its maximum HP by your level.</li>
<li><strong>Marvelous Gears</strong> Your innovation gains expert proficiency in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival. For any of these skills in which it was already an expert (because of being an advanced construct companion, for example), it gains master proficiency instead. If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, these proficiencies improve to master, or legendary if your construct innovation was already an expert. You must have the wonder gears modification to select this modification.</li>
<li><strong>Turret Configuration</strong> Your innovation can transform from a mobile construct to a stationary turret. Your construct companion can transform as a single action, which has the manipulate trait, turning into a turret in its space (or transforming back from a turret into its normal configuration). While it's a turret, your innovation is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized}, but the damage die from its projectile launcher increases to 1d6 and the range increment increases to 60 feet. You must have the projectile launcher modification to select this modification.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Breakthrough Weapon Modifications</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advanced Rangefinder (Ranged Only)</strong> A carefully tuned scope or targeting device makes your weapon especially good at hitting weak points. Your innovation gains the backstabber trait and increases its range increment by 10 feet.</li>
<li><strong>Aerodynamic Construction (Melee Only)</strong> You carefully engineer the shape of your weapon to maintain its momentum in attacks against successive targets. Your innovation gains the sweep trait and the versatile S trait.</li>
<li><strong>Inconspicuous Appearance (Melee Only)</strong> Your innovation is built for easy concealment and surprise attacks. It gains the backstabber and versatile P traits. If the weapon has light Bulk, it also gains the concealable trait.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated Gauntlet (One-Handed Weapon Only; Can't Have the Two-Hand Trait)</strong> Combining your weapon with a gauntlet, you make it so you can quickly switch between attacking with your weapon and tinkering using your hands. Your innovation gains the free-hand trait.</li>
<li><strong>Manifold Alloy</strong> You've devised several alloys that contain useful properties of various metals, and you replace a number of parts of your weapon or its ammunition with pieces from these alloys. Your weapon innovation is cold iron and silver. This means you deal more damage to a variety of supernatural creatures, such as demons, devils, and fey.</li>
<li><strong>Rope Shot (Ranged Only)</strong> Your weapon can shoot projectiles that split into simple ropes or nets around your foes' legs to trip your targets, and you can climb using the grappling hooks built into the weapon. Your weapon innovation gains the climbing and ranged trip traits.</li>
<li><strong>Tangle Line (Thrown Only)</strong> Your weapon has an extensible line that you can use to knock your enemies over and quickly recall the weapon back to your hand. Your innovation gains the ranged trip trait and the tethered trait.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style="float: right;">Level 7</span></h2>
<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Master Overdrive<span style="float: right;">Level 7</span></h2>
<p>Your mastery of invention and crafting enhances your Overdrive even further. You become a master in Crafting, and on a successful Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by a total of 2, replacing the increase from expert overdrive.</p>
<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style="float: right;">Level 7</span></h2>
<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>
<h2>Inventive Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>Through innovation and experimentation, you've made your inventions more effective and reliable. Your proficiency rank for your inventor class DC increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Offensive Boost<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>You've made additions to your innovation to upgrade your offensive capabilities. Your improvements make any Strikes that rely on your innovation deal an additional 1d6 damage, with a type determined by the boost you choose. If your innovation is armor, the boost applies to your melee unarmed Strikes and to your melee Strikes with one weapon you choose during daily preparations; if your innovation is a construct, the boost applies to your construct companion's Strikes; and if your innovation is a weapon, the boost applies to your Strikes with your innovation. You can spend downtime to switch to a different boost in the same way as switching your modification. Choose one of the following boosts, with the damage type in parentheses.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chill (Cold)</strong> Your innovation rapidly absorbs heat, creating an intense chill.</li>
<li><strong>Ignition (Fire)</strong> Your innovation shoots out jets of searing flame.</li>

<li><strong>Vitriol (Acid)</strong> Your innovation releases spurts of caustic acid.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>You've learned to better defend yourself against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert. If you have a medium or heavy armor innovation, you gain access to the critical specialization effect with your armor innovation.</p>
<h2>Resolve<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>
<h2>Alertness<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>Your attention to detail lets you remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Complete Reconfiguration<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>When it comes to crafting and tinkering, you've become incredibly adept at changing your modifications to adjust your innovation's functionality. When you spend downtime to reconfigure your innovation and succeed at your Crafting check, you can swap any number of modifications, swap your offensive boost, or retrain any number of modification feats, rather than one. You still must swap a modification only with one of the same type (initial, breakthrough, or revolutionary).</p>
<h2>Inventor Weapon Mastery<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>
<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style="float: right;">Level 15</span></h2>
<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>
<h2>Legendary Overdrive<span style="float: right;">Level 15</span></h2>
<p>Your peerless inventing and Crafting ability has supercharged your Overdrives. You become legendary in Crafting, and on a successful Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by a total of 3, replacing the increase from master overdrive.</p>
<h2>Revolutionary Innovation<span style="float: right;">Level 15</span></h2>
<p>You are an unparalleled genius and have discovered a technique that will revolutionize your chosen field-or at least for the time being, your innovation! Choose a revolutionary modification to apply to your innovation. You can also choose an initial or breakthrough modification of the same type instead, if you prefer.</p>
<h3>Revolutionary Armor Modifications</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automated Impediments</strong> Your armor uses electromagnetic fields, subharmonic distortions, or other techniques to make it difficult for those close to you to move unless you allow it. While wearing your armor, all spaces adjacent to you are difficult terrain for your enemies.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Barrier</strong> Your armor's defenses ablate any kind of energy coming your way. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to all energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive, and sonic damage) equal to 2 + half your level. You must have the harmonic oscillator, metallic reactance, or phlogistonic regulator modification to select this modification.</li>
<li><strong>Incredible Resistance</strong> You've improved upon your breakthrough modification's ability to resist damage. Choose one of the following breakthrough modifications your innovation has: dense plating, layered mesh, or tensile absorption. Increase the resistance you gain from that modification to be equal to your level, instead of half your level.</li>
<li><strong>Multisensory Mask (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've built a multisensory mask over your armor that protects you by distorting your figure from all senses, leaving behind only a hazy image, muffled sounds, and so forth. While wearing the armor, you gain concealment against all creatures, even if they are using a nonvisual precise sense, such as a bat's echolocation. As normal for effects that leave your location obvious, you can't use this concealment to Hide or Sneak. If you use a hostile action, the concealment ends until you restore the mask as a single action, which has the manipulate trait.</li>
<li><strong>Perfect Fortification (Power Suit Only)</strong> You've outfitted your armor with such heavy fortifications that deadly attacks often lose their edge. Each time you're critically hit while wearing the armor, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:13|showDC:owner] check. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. This isn't cumulative with fortification runes or other abilities that reduce critical hits with a flat check. Additionally, you gain resistance 2 + half your level against precision damage.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Protections</strong> Your armor has so many adjustments and precautions that it can guard against all physical damage. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to all physical damage (bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as persistent bleed damage) equal to half your level. You must have the dense plating, layered mesh, or tensile absorption breakthrough modification to select this modification.</li>
<li><strong>Rune Capacity</strong> Whether you've done some dabbling in orichalcum alloys or found another engineering solution, you've built your innovation in such a way that it can hold an additional property rune. Your innovation can have one more property rune than a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes with a +3 potency armor).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Revolutionary Construct Modifications</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flight Chassis</strong> You fit your construct with a means of flight, such as adding rotors or rebuilding it with wings and a lightweight construction. Your innovation gains a fly Speed of 25 feet.</li>
<li><strong>Miracle Gears</strong> As you perfect your innovation's cortex, it becomes much more intelligent. Its Intelligence modifier increases by 2, and it learns a language of your choice from among the languages you know. Your construct gains the ability to use actions that require greater Intelligence, like Coerce and Decipher Writing. Finally, your construct becomes legendary in two Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills of your choice. You must have the marvelous gears modification to select this modification.</li>
<li><strong>Resistant Coating</strong> Your innovation is hard to damage by any means. It gains resistance 5 to all damage (except adamantine).</li>
<li><strong>Runic Keystone</strong> You've incorporated a device similar to a runestone into your innovation, allowing it to hold a property rune, even though it isn't a weapon or suit of armor. An armor property rune affects your innovation itself if it would affect the wearer of the armor. A weapon property rune grants whatever properties it would normally grant to a weapon to your innovation's unarmed attacks, following all the requirements as normal (for instance, a vorpal rune would only apply to slashing melee unarmed attacks); if the rune affects only ranged attacks, it has no effect unless your innovation has a built-in ranged attack (from the projectile launcher initial modification, for example). If the rune would affect the physical shape or appearance of the weapon or armor itself, like glamered, the rune has no effect when etched into your construct.</li>
<li><strong>Wall Configuration</strong> Your innovation can transform from a mobile construct to a stationary battlefield emplacement. It can unfold as a 2-action activity that has the manipulate trait, changing from its usual form into a thin, straight wall of metal and gears up to 10 feet tall and 30 feet long. The wall must extend through your innovation's original space. While your construct is a wall, it can't take any actions except to use the same activity to transform back, and it can't defend itself easily, making it @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} and giving it an additional -2 status penalty to its AC. The wall blocks line of sight and effect unless your innovation has half its maximum HP or fewer, at which point holes in the wall allow creatures to see through and attack with cover, and Tiny creatures to slip through.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Revolutionary Weapon Modifications</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attack Refiner</strong> Your weapon makes minute recalibrations after every missed attack to ensure the next lands true. Your innovation gains the backswing and shove traits.</li>
<li><strong>Deadly Strike</strong> Through precise calculation, you've found the perfect shape for your weapon to deal extreme damage on a well-placed strike. Your innovation gains the deadly d8 trait. If your innovation was already deadly, it increases its deadly die to d12 instead of gaining deadly d8.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Damage</strong> You've made your innovation more powerful than other weapons of its kind. Increase your innovation's weapon damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). As normal, you can't increase your die by more than one size, so this modification isn't cumulative with complex simplicity.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible Weapon (Melee only)</strong> You've found a way to construct your weapon so that it can extend while leaving its balance unchanged. Your innovation gains the reach trait. If the weapon already had the reach trait, it increases your reach by an additional 10 feet, instead of the usual additional 5 feet.</li>
<li><strong>Impossible Alloy</strong> Other inventors claim it's not even technically possible, but you've managed to create several metal alloys that seem to work for only you. These alloys can damage opponents vulnerable to any one of the seven skymetals. Your innovation is treated as all seven skymetals (abysium, adamantine, djezet, inubrix, noqual, orichalcum, and siccatite). This means you deal more damage to a variety of creatures, though you don't apply any of the other special effects for weapons made of those skymetals.</li>
<li><strong>Momentum Retainer (Melee only)</strong> A special weighted device lets your weapon retain more of its momentum when you attack. Your innovation gains the forceful and versatile B traits.</li>
<li><strong>Omnirange Stabilizers (Ranged only)</strong> You've modified your innovation to be dangerous and effective at any range. If your innovation had the volley trait, remove the volley trait. Otherwise, increase your innovation's range increment by 50 feet or an amount equal to the weapon's base range increment, whichever is more.</li>
<li><strong>Rune Capacity</strong> Whether you've dabbled with orichalcum or found another engineering solution, you've built your innovation in such a way that it can hold an additional property rune. Your innovation can have one more property rune than a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes with a +3 potency weapon).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Inventive Mastery<span style="float: right;">Level 17</span></h2>
<p>Your inventions are incredibly effective. Your proficiency rank for your inventor class DC increases to master.</p>
<h2>Juggernaut<span style="float: right;">Level 17</span></h2>
<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>
<h2>Infinite Invention<span style="float: right;">Level 19</span></h2>
<p>Your ability to adjust your innovation has reached impossible heights, and you can use these skills to make major adjustments in your spare time. During your daily preparations, you automatically fix your innovation if it's destroyed or broken, and you can change to a different innovation (armor, construct, weapon, or other type you have access to) and change your modifications and offensive boost.</p>
<p>If you have any feats that had your previous innovation as a prerequisite, you can't use them until you retrain the feats as normal. However, it takes you only 1 day of downtime to retrain such a feat into a feat that has your new innovation as a prerequisite, instead of 1 week.</p>
<h2>Medium Armor Mastery<span style="float: right;">Level 19</span></h2>
<p>Your skill with armor improves, helping you avoid more blows. Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.</p>

<h2>Ascendance et historique</h2>
<p>En plus des capacités que votre classe vous accorde au niveau 1, vous bénéficiez des avantages de votre ascendance et de votre historique.</p>
<h2>Surrégime</h2>
<p>Vous disposez d'une ribambelle de petits appareils de votre propre invention, des stimulants musculaires aux pistons à concussion. Lorsque c'est nécessaire, vous pouvez les faire fonctionner en Surrégime pour vous aider au combat.</p>
<h2>Innovation</h2>
<p>Bien que vous soyez toujours en train de créer des inventions, il y en a une qui représente votre travail prépondérant, celle dont vous espérez - avec raffinement - qu'elle pourra changer le monde. Choisissez une innovation ci-dessous. Le niveau de votre innovation est égal à votre niveau. Si votre innovation est détruite, vous pouvez passer une journée d'intermède et tenter un test d'Artisanat avec un DD élevé pour votre niveau ; en cas de succès, vous le reconstruisez. Une innovation travaille seulement grace à votre maintenance et à votre bricolage constants et n'a pas de prix sur le marché.</p>
<p>Les innovations parmi lesquelles vous pouvez choisir sont les suivantes.</p>
<h3>Arme</h3>
<p>Votre innovation est une arme à l'apparence impossible améliorée avec de nombreux mécanismes inhabituels. Elle commence avec les mêmes statistiques qu'une arme simple ou de guerre courante de niveau 0 de votre choix ou qu'une autre arme simple ou de guerre de niveau 0 à laquelle vous avez accès. Vous pouvez utiliser à la place les statistiques d'une arme simple ou de guerre courante de niveau 1 de votre choix ou d'une autre arme simple ou de guerre de niveau 1 à laquelle vous avez accès mais vous devez payer le prix de l'arme. Une arme d'innovation peut se voir ajouter des runes fondamentales et de propriété de la même manière qu'une arme ordinaire. En raison des caractéristiques uniques de votre innovation, personne d'autre que vous n'est qualifié avec cette arme, même s'il est normalement qualifié (ou mieux) avec les armes simples ou de guerre. Si vous utilisez l'action surrégime, vous pouvez choisir de changer les dégâts supplémentaires du surrégime en dégâts de feu. Choisissez une modification d'arme initiale à appliquer à votre innovation, soit parmi celles qui suivent, soit parmi d'autres modifications d'armes initiales auxquelles vous avez accès. Ces modifications confèrent des caractéristiques supplémentaires à l'arme, avec parfois des capacités supplémentaires. Une modification peut conférer à votre arme le trait polyvalent avec un type de dégâts que l'arme pouvait déjà infliger, soit à partir de son type de dégâts de base, soit à partir d'un trait polyvalent existant. Dans ce cas, si vous sélectionnez cette modification, vous pouvez à la place choisir de donner à l'arme le trait polyvalent pour un type de dégâts différent : contondant, perforant ou tranchant.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cadre segmenté :</strong> Des charnières, des pinces et des pièces télescopiques rendent votre innovation pliable et ajustable. Il gagne le trait polyvalent pour les coups contondants, perforants et les coups tranchants. Vous pouvez interagir pour réduire l'objet à un Encombrement léger ou pour le ramener à votre forme normale. Lorsqu'il est réduit à un volume léger, il possède le trait dissimulable qui vous confère un bonus de circonstances de +2 aux tests pour cacher ou dissimuler l'arme.</li>
<li><strong>Composition volumineuse (Corps-à-corps seulement) :</strong> Les surfaces émoussées et la construction robuste font de votre arme un objet lourd et ressemblant à une masse. Votre innovation gagne les traits pousser et polyvalent C.</li>
<li><strong>Forme enchevêtrée (Corps-à-corps seulement) :</strong> Vous avez modifié votre arme pour y inclure un enchevêtrement de fils ou de sangles ou pour avoir une construction flexible. Votre innovation obtient les traits saisir et croc-en-jambe.</li>
<li><strong>Outils de pacification (Corps-à-corps seulement) :</strong> Des matériaux plus souples permettent à votre arme d' assommer plutôt que de tuer et des protubérances spéciales vous permettent d'attraper les armes et de désarmer vos ennemis. Votre innovation gagne les traits désarmer et non létal. Vous pouvez choisir d'appliquer le trait non létal lors de chaque attaque avec votre innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Piques gênantes (Corps-à-corps seulement) :</strong> Vous avez ajouté à votre arme de longues pointes qui s'accrochent et que vous pouvez utiliser pour entraver le mouvement de vos ennemis. Votre innovation obtient les traits P gênant et polyvalent.</li>
<li><strong>Poids dynamique (Arme au corps-à-corps à une main seulement ; Ne peut avoir le trait agile, attaché ou main libre) :</strong> La distribution de poids modifiée de votre arme peut augmenter la puissance en échange de prendre plus de mains pour la manier. Votre innovation obtient le trait deux-mains, avec un dé de dégâts d'une taille supérieure à la taille de dé de dégâts normal de l'arme (par exemple, une épée longue obtiendrait le trait deux mains d10). Votre innovation obtient aussi le trait polyvalent C.</li>
<li><strong>Pointes de rasoir (Corps-à-corps seulement) :</strong> Vous pouvez renverser et taillader vos ennemis avec des lames tranchantes et incurvées ajoutées à votre arme. Votre innovation gagne les traits croc-en-jambe et polyvalent T.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicité complexe (Arme simple seulement) :</strong> Augmentez le dé de dégâts de votre innovation d'arme de un cran (d4 au d6, d6 au d8, d8 au d10, d10 au d12). De plus, il obtient un des traits suivants de votre choix : Polyvalent C, Polyvalent P ou Polyvalent T.</li>
<li><strong>Tête modulaire :</strong> Vous avez construit une surface de frappe polyvalente et réglable pour votre arme ou vous avez fabriqué des munitions spéciales que vous pouvez modifier rapidement. Votre innovation gagne le trait polyvalent pour contondant, perforant et tranchant. Lorsque vous choisissez d'utiliser le trait polyvalent, vous pouvez également choisir de donner à l'arme le trait non létal si elle ne l'a pas encore ou de supprimer ce trait si elle est actuellement non létale.</li>
<li><strong>Tir émoussé (Distance seulement) :</strong> Votre innovation en matière d'arme peut limer les bords de vos munitions et ajuster la force émoussée du tir pour délivrer une attaque contondante lorsque cela est nécessaire ainsi que pour éviter de porter un coup mortel avec un tir autrement mortel. Votre innovation gagne les traits polyvalent C et non létal. Vous pouvez choisir d'appliquer ou non le trait non létal à chaque attaque avec votre innovation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Armure</h3>
<p>Votre innovation est une armure moyenne à la pointe de la technologie avec une variété de gadgets et d'appareils. Choisissez l'un des ensembles de statistiques des armures d'innovation pour votre armure d'innovation (ou choisissez un autre ensemble de statistiques d'armure d'innovation auquel vous avez accès).</p>
<p>Votre armure d'innovation peut se voir ajouter des runes fondamentales et de propriété de la même manière que les armures ordinaires. En raison des caractéristiques uniques de votre innovation, personne n'est qualifié dans son utilisation, même s'ils devraient normalement être qualifiés (ou mieux) avec une armure intermédiaire. Choisissez une modification initiale d'armure à appliquer à votre innovation, soit parmi les suivantes, soit parmi les autres modifications initiales d'armure auxquelles vous avez accès.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accélérateurs de vitesse :</strong> Vous avez des accélérateurs dans votre armure qui augmentent votre vitesse. Vous gagnez un bonus de statut de +1,5 m à votre vitesse, qui passe à +3 m sous l'effet de surrégime.</li>
<li><strong>Amortisseurs subtils (Costume de subterfuge seulement):</strong> Vous avez conçu votre armure pour vous aider à vous fondre dans la masse et à amortir légèrement le bruit. Lorsque vous mettez votre armure en surrégime, les amortisseurs augmentent leur effet, améliorant ainsi votre furtivité. Lorsque vous êtes sous l'effet de surrégime, vous obtenez un bonus de circonstances de +1 aux tests de Discrétion. Si vous êtes un maître en Artisanat, cela passe à un bonus de circonstances de +2.</li>
<li><strong>Exosquelette musculaire (Costume de puissance seulement):</strong> Votre armure soutient vos muscles grâce à un exosquelette soigneusement conçu. Lorsque vous placez votre armure en surrégime, l'exosquelette complète également vos dons d'Athlétisme. Lorsque vous êtes sous l'effet de surrégime, vous gagnez un bonus de circonstances de +1 aux tests d'Athlétisme ; si vous êtes maître en Artisanat, ce bonus passe à +2.</li>
<li><strong>Oscillateur harmonique :</strong> Vous avez conçu votre armure pour qu'elle vibre de manière inaudible à la bonne fréquence afin de créer des interférences contre les ondes de force et les ondes sonores. Vous obtenez une résistance égale à 3 + la moitié de votre niveau aux dégâts de force et de son. Sous l'effet de surrégime, cette résistance augmente de 2.</li>
<li><strong>Protection surnaturelle :</strong> Ce n'est pas parce que vous utilisez la science que vous ne pouvez pas construire votre armure avec des matériaux soigneusement choisis et des bidules conçus pour vous protéger des attaques d'un autre monde. Vous gagnez une résistance égale à 3 + la moitié de votre niveau aux dégâts négatifs ou aux dégâts positifs si vous bénéficiez de guérison négative (comme lorsque vous êtes un dhampir). Vous obtenez la même résistance à tous les types de dégâts d'alignement - bon, chaotique, loyal, mauvais - qui peuvent vous causer des dégâts (notez que les créatures ne subissent pas un type de dégâts d'alignement donné à moins d'être d'un alignement opposé ; par exemple, vous ne pouvez subir des dégâts mauvais que si vous êtes d'alignement bon).</li>
<li><strong>Réactance métallique :</strong> Les alliages de métaux de votre armure sont soigneusement assemblés pour mettre à la terre l'électricité et protéger des réactions chimiques acides. Vous obtenez une résistance égale à 3 + la moitié de votre niveau aux dégâts d'acide et d'électricité. Sous l'effet de surrégime, la résistance augmente de 2.</li>
<li><strong>Régulateur phlogistonique :</strong> Une couche d'isolation à l'intérieur de votre armure vous protège des fluctuations rapides de température. Vous gagnez une résistance égale à la moitié de votre niveau aux dégâts de froid et de feu. Sous l'effet de surrégime, la résistance augmente de 2.</li>

<h3>Créature artificielle</h3>
<p>Votre innovation est une créature mécanique, comme une construction d'horlogerie faite de rouages et d'engrenages. Il s'agit d'un prototype de compagnon créature artificielle et vous pouvez ajuster la plupart de ses statistiques de base en prenant des dons à des niveaux plus élevés, comme Compagnon avancé. Si vous utilisez l'action surrégime, votre construction bénéficie des mêmes avantages que vous en matière de surrégime et elle subit également la même quantité de dégâts de feu en cas d'échec critique.</p>
<p>Vous savez comment passer du temps supplémentaire à diriger, contrôler ou programmer votre innovation créature artificielle pour mener un plan d'action plus complexe. Vous pouvez dépenser 2 actions pour Diriger au lieu d'une lorsque vous dirigez votre compagnon créature artificielle ; votre compagnon créature artificielle peut alors utiliser une action supplémentaire (normalement 3 actions, au lieu de 2).</p>
<p>Choisissez une modification de créature artificielle initiale à appliquer à votre innovation, soit parmi les suivantes, soit parmi d'autres modifications de créature artificielle initiale auxquelles vous avez accès. Ces modifications altèrent les capacités ou la forme de la créature artificielle.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capteurs sensoriels :</strong> Des outils sensoriels supplémentaires procurent à votre innovation une vision nocturne et la vision dans le noir, ainsi que Perception des vibrations (imprécis) tremorsense jusqu'à une portée de 9 m.</li>
<li><strong>Construction amphibie :</strong> Une flottabilité accrue, des gouvernes et un moyen de propulsion tel qu'une nageoire caudale ou une puissante hélice rendent votre créature artificielle capable de se déplacer dans l'eau. Votre innovation gagne une vitesse de nage de 7,5 m.</li>
<li><strong>Dextérité manuelle :</strong> Votre créature artificielle innovation possède des mains articulées ou des appendices similaires avec une dextérité manuelle significative. Elle peut accomplir des actions de manipulations avec jusqu'à deux de ses membres. Comme à l'ordinaire pour un compagnon, elle ne peut pas manier des armes ou tenir des objets qui ne possèdent pas le trait compagnon et elle ne peut activer des objets.</li>
<li><strong>Engrenages merveilleux :</strong> Vous intégrez des compétences spécialisées dans l'intelligence de base de votre créature artificielle. Votre innovation devient qualifiée en Intimidation, Discrétion et Survie.</li>
<li><strong>Lance-projectiles :</strong> Votre créature artificielle possède un lance fléchette monté, un canon intégré ou autre armement similaire. Votre innovation obtient une attaque à mains nues à distance qui inflige 1d4 dégâts contondants ou perforants (vous choisissez lorsque vous prenez cette modification). L'attaque possède le trait propulsif et un facteur de portée de 9 m.</li>
<li><strong>Mobilité accélérée :</strong> Des pieds motorisés, des engrenages efficaces dans les roues ou les chhenilles ou des accélérateurs supplémentaires rendent votre créature artificielle plus rapide. La vitesse de votre innovation passe à 12 m.</li>
<li><strong>Taille augmentée :</strong> Vous avez construit en plus grand votre créature artificielle innovation par rapport à la plupart. Votre créature artificielle est Grande. Si vous avez cette modification et que votre créature artificielle innovation devient un compagnon créature artificielle avancé ou acquiert autrement la capacité de devenir Grand, vous pouvez immédiatement changer la taille accrue en une modification de créature artificielle initiale différente.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exploser</h2>
<p>Votre innovation est une création qui ne tient à peine debout que grâce à votre propre ingénierie et qui est toujours sur le point de s'effondrer. Bien que cela représente un risque, cela signifie également que vous pouvez la faire accomplir des choses qui vont bien au-delà de ses spécifications de conception en utilisant des actions instables spéciales. Les actions instables sont basées sur des fonctionnalités expérimentales de votre innovation dont même vous ne pouvez pas entièrement prédire les effets. Après avoir utilisé une action instable sur une innovation, en utiliser une autre est dangereux.</p>
<p>Si les inventeurs peuvent apprendre diverses actions instables au cours de leur carrière, tous savent au moins comment faire Exploser leur innovation.</p>
<h2>Inventeur hors pair</h2>
<p>Vous êtes constamment en train d'inventer et vos compétences en Artisanat sont irréprochables. Vous obtenez le don de compétence Inventeur, même si vous ne remplissez pas ses prérequis</p>
<h2>Blocage au bouclier</h2>

Choisissez une modification révolutionnaire à appliquer à votre innovation. Vous pouvez aussi choisir une modification initiale ou de rupture du même type, si vous préférez.</p>
<h3>Modifications d'arme révolutionnaires</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alliage impossible :</strong> Les autres inventeurs prétendent que ce n'est même pas techniquement possible mais vous avez réussi à créer plusieurs alliages métalliques qui semblent ne fonctionner que pour vous. Ces alliages peuvent endommager les adversaires vulnérables à l'un des sept métaux célestes. Votre innovation est traitée comme étant faite de sept métaux célestes. (abyssium, adamantium, djezet, inubrix, noqual, orichalque et siccatite). Cela signifie que vous faites plus de dégâts à un éventail de créatures, bien que vous ne puissiez appliquer le moindre autre effet spécifique des armes faites de ces métaux célestes.</li>
<li><strong>Arme extensible (Corps-à-corps seulement) :</strong> Vous avez trouvé un moyen de construire votre arme de manière à ce qu'elle puisse s'étendre tout en conservant son équilibre. Votre innovation gagne le trait allonge. Si l'arme avait déjà le trait allonge, elle augmente votre allonge de 3 m supplémentaires, au lieu des 1,5 m supplémentaires habituels.</li>
<li><strong>Capacité runique :</strong> Que vous ayez bricolé des alliages d'orichalque ou trouvé une autre solution technique, vous avez construit votre innovation de manière à ce qu'elle puisse contenir une rune de propriété supplémentaire. Votre innovation peut avoir une rune de propriété de plus qu'un objet normal de son type (jusqu'à un maximum de quatre runes de propriété avec une arme de puissance +3).</li>
<li><strong>Dégâts améliorés :</strong> Vous avez rendu votre innovation plus puissante que les autres armes de son type. Augmentez d'un cran le dé de dégâts de l'arme de votre innovation (de d4 à d6, d6 à d8, d8 à d10, d10 à d12). Comme à l'ordinaire, vous ne pouvez pas augmenter votre dé de plus d'une taille, de sorte que cette modification n'est pas cumulable avec simplicité complexe.</li>
<li><strong>Frappe mortelle :</strong> Grâce à des calculs précis, vous avez trouvé la forme parfaite pour que votre arme infliger des dégâts extrêmes sur un coup bien placé. Votre innovation gagne le trait mortel d8. Si votre innovation avait déjà le trait mortel, elle passe à mortel d12 au lieu de gagner mortel d8.</li>
<li><strong>Raffineur d'attaque :</strong> Votre arme effectue des recalibrages minutieux après chaque attaque manquée pour s'assurer que la prochaine atterrit correctement. Votre innovation obtient les traits prise d'élan et pousser.</li>
<li><strong>Retenue d'élan (Corps-à-corps seulement) :</strong> Un dispositif spécial de lestage permet à votre arme de conserver une partie de son élan lorsque vous attaquez. Votre innovation gagne les traits percutant et polyvalent C.</li>
<li><strong>Stabilisateurs omniportée (À distance seulement) :</strong> Vous avez modifié votre innovation pour qu'elle soit dangereuse et efficace à n'importe quelle distance. Si votre innovation avait le trait volée, supprimez ce trait. Autrement, augmentez le facteur de portée de votre innovation de 15 mètres ou d'un montant égal au facteur de portée de base de l'arme, selon ce qui est le plus élevé.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Modifications d'armure révolutionnaire</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Barrière d'énergie :</strong> Les défenses de votre armure abolissent tout type d'énergie qui se dirige vers vous. Lorsque vous portez votre armure, vous gagnez une résistance à tous les dégâts énergétiques (acide, électricité, feu, force, froid, dégâts négatifs, dégâts positifs et soniques) égale à 2 + la moitié de votre niveau. Vous devez avoir la modification oscillateur harmonique, réactance métallique ou régulateur phlogistonique pour choisir cette modification.</li>
<li><strong>Capacité runique :</strong> Que vous ayez bricolé des alliages d'orichalque ou trouvé une autre solution technique, vous avez construit votre innovation de manière à ce qu'elle puisse contenir une rune de propriété supplémentaire. Votre innovation peut avoir une rune de propriété de plus qu'un objet normal de son type (jusqu'à un maximum de quatre runes de propriété avec une armure de puissance de +3).</li>
<li><strong>Fortification parfaite (Costume de puissance seulement) :</strong> Vous avez Vous avez équipé votre armure de renforts si importants que les attaques mortelles perdent souvent de leur efficacité. Chaque fois que vous êtes l'objet d'un coup critique alors que vous portez l'armure, faites un @Check[type:flat|dc:13|showDC:owner]{Test nu DD 13}. En cas de succès, cela devient un coup ordinaire. Ce n'est pas cumulatif avec les runes de fortification ou les autres capacités qui réduisent les coups critiques avec un test nu. De plus, vous obtenez une résistance égale à 2 + la moitié de votre niveau contre les dégâts de précision.</li>
<li><strong>Masque multisensoriel (Costume de subterfuge seulement) :</strong> Vous avez construit un masque multisensoriel sur votre armure qui vous protège en déformant votre silhouette de tous les sens, ne laissant derrière vous qu'une image floue, des sons étouffés, etc. Lorsque vous portez l'armure, vous gagnez un camouflage contre toutes les créatures, même si elles utilisent un sens précis non visuel, comme l'écholocation d'une chauve-souris. Comme c'est le cas pour les effets qui rendent votre emplacement évident, vous ne pouvez pas utiliser cette dissimulation pour vous cacher ou Être furtif. Si vous utilisez une action hostile, la dissimulation prend fin jusqu'à ce que vous restauriez le masque en une seule action, qui possède le trait manipulation.</li>
<li><strong>Obstacles automatisés :</strong> Votre armure utilise des champs électromagnétiques, des distorsions subharmoniques ou d'autres techniques pour rendre difficile le déplacement de ceux qui sont proches, à moins que vous ne le permettiez. Lorsque vous portez votre armure, toutes les cases adjacentes à vous sont des terrains difficiles pour vos ennemis.</li>
<li><strong>Protections physiques :</strong> Votre armure comporte tellement de réglages et de sécurités qu'elle peut vous protéger contre tous les dégâts physiques. Lorsque vous portez votre armure, vous gagnez une résistance à tous les dégâts physiques (dégâts contondants, perforants et tranchants, ainsi que les dégâts de saignement persistants) égale à la moitié de votre niveau. Vous devez avoir la modification de rupture Plaquage dense, Mailles superposées ou Absorption de la traction pour choisir cette modification.</li>
<li><strong>Résistance incroyable :</strong> Vous avez amélioré la capacité de votre modification de rupture à résister aux dégâts. Choisissez l'une des modifications révolutionnaires suivantes dont dispose votre innovation : plaquage dense, mailles superposées ou absorption de la traction. Augmentez la résistance que vous obtenez de cette modification pour qu'elle soit égale à votre niveau, au lieu de la moitié de votre niveau.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Modification révolutionnaires de créature artificielle</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chassis volant :</strong> Vous équipez votre construction d'un moyen de voler, par exemple en ajoutant des rotors ou en la reconstruisant avec des ailes en allégeant votre créature artificielle. Votre innovation gagne une vitesse de vol de 7,5 m.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration de mur :</strong> Votre innovation peut se transformer d'une créature artificielle mobile en un emplacement stationnaire sur le champ de bataille. Elle peut se déployer par une activité à 2 actions ayant le trait manipulation, en changeant sa forme habituelle en un mur fin et droit formé de métal et d'engrenages de 3 m de haut et 9 m de long. Le mur doit s'étendre en passant à travers la case d'origine de votre innovation. Tant que votre créature artificielle est un mur, elle ne peut entreprendre aucune action, sauf celle qui consiste à utiliser la même activité pour se retransformer, et elle ne peut pas se défendre facilement, ce qui la rend @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Prise au dépourvu } et lui donne une pénalité de statut supplémentaire de -2 à sa CA. Le mur bloque la ligne de vue et l'effet à moins que votre innovation soit réduite à au moins la moitié de ses PV maximum, auquel cas des trous dans le mur permettent aux créatures de voir à travers et d'attaquer avec un abri et aux créatures minuscules de passer à travers.</li>
<li><strong>Engrenages miraculeux :</strong> Lorsque vous perfectionnez le cortex de votre innovation, celle-ci devient beaucoup plus intelligente. Son modificateur d'Intelligence augmente de 2, et elle apprend une langue de votre choix parmi les langues que vous connaissez. Votre créature artificielle gagne la capacité d'utiliser des actions qui demandent une plus grande Intelligence, comme Contraindre et Déchiffrer un texte Enfin, votre créature artificielle devient légendaire dans deux compétences basées sur l'Intelligence ou le Charisme de votre choix. Vous devez avoir la modification engrenages merveilleux pour choisir cette modification.</li>
<li><strong>Couche résistante :</strong> Votre innovation est difficile à endommager par tous les moyens. Elle gagne une résistance de 5 à tous les dégâts (sauf l'adamantium).</li>
<li><strong>Support runique :</strong> Vous avez intégré un dispositif similaire à une pierre runique dans votre innovation, lui permettant de contenir une rune de propriété, même si ce n'est pas une arme ou une armure. Une rune de propriété d'armure affecte votre innovation elle-même si elle affecte le porteur de l'armure. Une rune de propriété d'arme accorde aux attaques à mains nues de votre innovation les propriétés qu'elle accorderait normalement à une arme, en respectant toutes les conditions ordinaires (par exemple, une rune vorpale ne s'appliquerait qu'aux attaques au corps-à-corps à mains nues tranchantes) ; si la rune n'affecte que les attaques à distance, elle n'a aucun effet, sauf si votre innovation possède une attaque à distance intégrée (grâce à la modification initiale de lanceur de projectiles, par exemple). Si la rune affecte la forme physique ou l'apparence de l'arme ou de l'armure elle-même, comme mimétisme, la rune n'a aucun effet lorsqu'elle est gravée sur votre créature artificielle.</li>
