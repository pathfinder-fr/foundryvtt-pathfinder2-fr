------ Description (en) ------
<p><em>The power of nature is impossible to resist. It can bring ruin to the stoutest fortress in minutes, reducing even the mightiest works to rubble, burning them to ash, burying them beneath an avalanche of snow, or drowning them beneath the waves. It can provide endless bounty and breathtaking splendor to those who respect it - and an agonizing death to those who take it too lightly. You are one of those who hear nature's call. You stand in awe of the majesty of its power and give yourself over to its service.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Ability: WISDOM</strong></p>
<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>
<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>
<h1>Roleplaying the Druid</h1>
<h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2>
<p>You call upon the forces of nature to defeat your enemies and protect your allies. You cast spells that draw upon primal magic to protect yourself and your friends, heal their wounds, or summon deadly animals to fight at your side. Depending on your bond to nature, you might call upon powerful elemental magic or change shape into a terrifying beast.</p>
<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>
<p>You represent balance and a reasoned approach to problems, looking for solutions that not only are best for the natural world, but also allow the creatures within it to live in harmony and peace. You often propose compromises that allow both sides to gain what they truly need, even if they can't have all that they desire.</p>
<h2>While Exploring...</h2>
<p>Your nature skills are invaluable. You track down enemies, navigate the wilderness, and use spells to detect magical auras around you. You might even ask wild animals to lend their extraordinary senses and scouting abilities to your group.</p>
<h2>In Downtime...</h2>
<p>You might craft magic items or potions. Alternatively, your tie to nature might lead you to tend a wilderness area, befriending beasts and healing the wounds caused by civilization. You might even teach sustainable farming and animal husbandry techniques that allow others to subsist off the land without harming the natural balance.</p>
<h2>You Might...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have a deep and meaningful respect for the power of nature.</li>
<li>Be in constant awe of the natural world, eager to share it with others but wary of their influence upon it.</li>
<li>Treat plants and animals as allies, working with them to reach your goals.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Others Probably...</h2>
<ul>
<li>View you as a representative of nature, and are sure you can control it.</li>
<li>Assume you're a recluse who avoids society and cities and prefers to live in the wild.</li>
<li>Consider you a mystic, similar to a priest, but answering only to the forces of nature.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Anathema</h2>
<p>As stewards of the natural order, druids find affronts to nature anathema. If you perform enough acts that are anathema to nature, you lose your magical abilities that come from the druid class, including your primal spellcasting and the benefits of your order. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.7Fd4lxozd11MQ55N]{Atone}</em> ritual.</p>
<p>The following acts are anathema to all druids:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using metal armor or shields.</li>
<li>Despoiling natural places.</li>
<li>Teaching the Druidic language to non-druids.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each druidic order also has additional anathema acts, detailed in the order's entry.</p>
<p>See specific orders for more information.</p>
<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>
<p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>
<h2>Druidic Language</h2>
<p>You know Druidic, a secret language known to only druids, in addition to any languages you know through your ancestry. Druidic has its own alphabet. Teaching the Druidic language to non-druids is anathema.</p>
<h2>Druidic Order</h2>
<p>Upon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants you a class feat, an order spell (see below), and an additional trained skill tied to your order. While you'll always be a member of your initial order, it's not unheard of for a druid to request to study with other orders in search of greater understanding of the natural world, and PC druids are among the most likely to blend the powers of different orders.</p>
<p>Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order.</p>
<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots to cast, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Selecting druid feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points.</p>
<p>Orders can be found here (@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.POBvoXifa9HaejAg]{Animal}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.u4nlOzPj2WHkIj9l]{Leaf}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.acqqlYmti8D9QJi0]{Storm}, and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.v0EjtiwdeMj8ykI0]{Wild}).</p>
<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>
<p>At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies, representing your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>
<h2>Primal Spellcasting</h2>
<p>The power of the wild world flows through you. You can cast primal spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a druid, you can usually hold a primal focus (such as holly and mistletoe) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a spell component pouch.</p>
<p>At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list in this book, or from other primal spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>
<p>As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3-11: Druid Spells per Day.</p>
<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier.</p>
<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>
<p>When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>
<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>
<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of druid spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level druid, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level druid, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>

<p><em>Il est impossible de résister au pouvoir de la nature. Elle peut détruire la plus solide des forteresses en quelques minutes, en réduisant à l’état de gravats ou en cendres les édifices les plus robustes, en les ensevelissant sous une avalanche de neige ou en les noyant sous les vagues. Elle peut se montrer infiniment généreuse et incroyablement faste avec ceux qui la respectent – et définitivement mortelle envers ceux qui la négligent. Vous êtes l’un de ces individus qui perçoivent l’appel de la nature. Vous êtes en admiration devant la majesté de sa puissance et consacrez votre vie à son service.</em></p>

<h1>Jouer un druide</h1>
<h2>Lors des rencontres de combat...</h2>
<p>Vous invoquez les forces de la nature pour vaincre vos ennemis et protéger vos alliés.

<h2>En exploration...</h2>
<p>Vos compétences sur la nature sont inestimables. Vous pourchassez les ennemis, parcourez les étendues sauvages sans vous perdre et utilisez des sorts pour détecter les auras magiques à proximité.

<h2>Pendant un intermède...</h2>
<p>Vous pouvez fabriquer des objets magiques ou des potions. Par ailleurs, votre rapport intime avec la nature peut vous inciter à prendre soin d’une région sauvage, vous liant d’amitié avec les animaux et réparant les dégâts engendrés par la civilisation. Vous pouvez même enseigner des techniques d’agriculture et d’élevage durables qui permettent aux populations d’exploiter les terres pour subvenir à leurs besoins sans mettre en péril l’équilibre naturel.</p>
<h2>Vous...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avez un profond respect pour la puissance de la nature.</li>
<li>Êtes constamment fasciné par le monde naturel et toujours prêt à partager ses bienfaits avec les autres tout en vous méfiant de leur impact sur lui.</li>

<h2>Anathème</h2>
<p>En tant que gardiens de l’ordre naturel, les druides trouvent que les affronts faits à la nature sont des anathèmes. Toutefois, si vous accomplissez trop d’actes anathèmes à la nature, vous perdez les capacités magiques que vous confère la classe de druide, notamment votre capacité d’incantation primordiale et les avantages que vous procure votre ordre. Vous ne pouvez récupérer ces capacités que si vous montrez un réel désir de repentance en accomplissant un rituel de <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.7Fd4lxozd11MQ55N]{Pénitence}</em>.</p>
<p>Les agissements suivants sont considérés comme anathèmes par tous les druides :</p>
<ul>
<li>L’utilisation d’armures ou de boucliers métalliques.</li>
<li>La détérioration de sites naturels.</li>
<li>L’enseignement de la langue druidique à des non-druides.</li>
</ul>
<p>Les ordres druidiques comprennent également d’autres actes anathèmes décrits dans la section de chacun.</p>

<p>En plus des capacités que votre classe vous accorde au niveau 1, vous bénéficiez des avantages de votre ascendance et de votre historique.</p>
<h2>Le druidique</h2>
<p>Vous connaissez le druidique, une langue secrète uniquement connue des druides, en plus des éventuelles langues que vous connaissez grâce à votre ascendance. Le druidique possède son propre alphabet. L’enseignement de la langue druidique à des non-druides est anathème.</p>
<h2>L'ordre druidique</h2>
<p>En devenant un druide, vous rejoignez un ordre druidique qui vous confère un don de classe, un sort d’ordre et le rang qualifié dans une compétence supplémentaire associée à votre ordre. Même si vous resterez toujours un membre du premier ordre que vous avez rejoint, on a déjà vu certains druides partir étudier au sein d’autres ordres en quête d’une compréhension approfondie du monde naturel et les PJ druides sont certainement les individus les plus à même de combiner les pouvoirs de plusieurs ordres.</p>
<p>Les sorts d’ordre forment un type particulier de sorts focalisés. Il faut dépenser 1 point de focalisation pour lancer un sort focalisé et vous commencez avec une réserve de focalisation de 1 point. Elle se remplit lors de vos préparatifs quotidiens et vous pouvez récupérer 1 point de focalisation en utilisant l’activité Refocaliser pendant dix minutes pour communier avec les esprits locaux de la nature ou pour prendre soin de la nature d’une façon qui convient à votre ordre.</p>
<p>Un sort focalisé est automatiquement intensifié à la moitié de votre niveau arrondi au supérieur, comme un tour de magie. Un sort focalisé n’a pas besoin d’emplacement de sort et vous ne pouvez pas utiliser un tel emplacement pour le lancer. Choisir des dons de druide peut vous accorder d’autres sorts focalisés et augmenter la taille de votre réserve de focalisation, bien que cette dernière ne puisse jamais contenir plus de 3 points.</p>
<p>Voici les ordres druidiques :</p>
<ul>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.POBvoXifa9HaejAg]{Ordre animal}</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.u4nlOzPj2WHkIj9l]{Ordre de la feuille}</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.NdeFvIXdHwKYLiUj]{Ordre de la flamme}</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.fKTewWlYgFuhl4KA]{Ordre de la pierre}</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.acqqlYmti8D9QJi0]{Ordre de la tempête}</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.FuUXyv2yBs7zRgqT]{Ordre de la vague}</li>
<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.v0EjtiwdeMj8ykI0]{Ordre féroce}</li>
</ul>
<h2>Maîtrises initiales</h2>
<p>Au niveau 1, vous obtenez un nombre de maîtrises qui représentent votre entraînement de base. Elles sont indiquées au début de cette classe.</p>
<h2>Incantation primordiale</h2>
<p>La puissance primordiale de la nature sauvage s’écoule à travers vous. Vous lancez des sorts primordiaux avec l’activité @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Lancer un sort} et pouvez fournir des composants matériels, somatiques et verbaux lors de l’incantation. Étant donné que vous êtes un druide, vous pouvez normalement brandir un focaliseur primordial (tel que du gui et du houx) pour lancer les sorts nécessitant des composants matériels au lieu d’utiliser une bourse de composants.</p>
<p>Au niveau 1, vous pouvez chaque matin préparer deux sorts de niveau 1 et cinq tours de magie que vous choisissez parmi les sorts communs de la liste des sorts primordiaux ou parmi les autres sorts primordiaux auxquels vous avez accès. Vos sorts restent à votre disposition jusqu’à ce que vous les lanciez ou que vous les prépariez de nouveau. Le nombre de sorts que vous pouvez préparer est représenté par vos emplacements de sort.</p>
<p>Au fur et à mesure que vous gagnez des niveaux de druide, le nombre de sorts que vous pouvez préparer chaque jour augmente, tout comme le niveau le plus élevé de sort que vous pouvez lancer, comme indiqué dans le tableau des sorts de druide quotidiens.</p>
<p>Certains sorts exigent un jet d’attaque de sort pour déterminer leur efficacité ou obligent vos ennemis à faire un jet contre leur DD (en général un jet de sauvegarde). Comme la Sagesse est votre caractéristique essentielle, vos jets d’attaque de sort et le DD de vos sorts utilisent votre modificateur de Sagesse.</p>
<h3><strong>Les sorts intensifiés</strong></h3>
<p>Quand vous obtenez des emplacements de sort de niveau 2 et plus, vous pouvez les remplir avec des versions plus puissantes de sorts de niveau inférieur. Ceci augmente le niveau du sort en l’intensifiant pour qu’il corresponde à celui de l’emplacement utilisé. De nombreux sorts voient ainsi certains de leurs paramètres améliorés quand ils sont intensifiés à des niveaux supérieurs.</p>
<h3><strong>Les tours de magie</strong></h3>
<p>Un tour de magie est un type de sort qui n’utilise pas d’emplacement de sort. Il se lance à volonté chaque jour, aussi souvent que vous le désirez. Un tour de magie est toujours automatiquement intensifié jusqu’à la moitié de votre niveau arrondi à l’entier supérieur, donc généralement égal au sort de plus haut niveau que vous pouvez lancer en tant que druide. Par exemple, les tours de magie d’un druide de niveau 1 sont de niveau 1, tandis que ceux d’un druide de niveau 5 sont de niveau 3.</p>
