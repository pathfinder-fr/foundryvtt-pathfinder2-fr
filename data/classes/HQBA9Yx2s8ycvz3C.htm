------ Description (en) ------
<p><em>Combining the physicality and technique of a warrior with the ability to cast arcane magic, you seek to perfect the art of fusing spell and strike. While the hefty tome you carry reflects hours conducting arcane research, your enemies need no reminder of your training. They recognize it as you take them down.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Ability: STRENGTH OR DEXTERITY</strong></p>
<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>
<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>
<h1>Roleplaying the Magus</h1>
<h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2>
<p>You channel spells through your weapon or body to hit enemies with a powerful attack and spell combination. Because your spells per day are limited, you often rely on trusty, carefully chosen cantrips and focus spells. When necessary, you know how to win a fight without magic.</p>
<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>
<p>Your education and breadth of experience make you knowledgeable about many subjects. You can contribute information related to your scholarly pursuits, especially about magic.</p>
<h2>While Exploring...</h2>
<p>Your flexibility means you might look for magical auras, remain on guard, or even sneak around. Your ability to fill different niches means that your role often depends on the talents of the other members of your group.</p>
<h2>In Downtime...</h2>
<p>You split your time between magical pursuits, like researching spells and crafting items, and martial practice, such as retraining combat abilities to learn new techniques.</p>
<h2>You Might...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continually refine your spell and item selections to suit your personal style, or prepare battle plans and spell lists for a variety of situations.</li>
<li>Socialize with scholars of magic and veteran combatants alike, seeking out masters to teach you new techniques.</li>
<li>Overreach with ambitious plans that pull you in too many directions at once.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Others Probably...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wonder how you can keep on top of two disparate disciplines at the same time.</li>
<li>Believe you have a broad enough skill set to take care of yourself in most situations.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1>
<p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way.</p>
<h2>Perception</h2>
<p>Trained in Perception</p>
<h2>Saving Throws</h2>
<p>Expert in Fortitude</p>

<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>
<p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>
<h2>Arcane Spellcasting</h2>
<p>You study spells so you can combine them with your attacks or solve problems that strength of arms alone can't handle. You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a magus, you can draw replacement sigils with the tip of your weapon or your free hand for spells requiring material components, replacing them with somatic components instead of needing a material component pouch. At 1st level, you can prepare one 1st-level spell and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below). Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a magus, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 2-2: Magus Spells per Day. Because you split your focus between physical training and magical scholarship, you have no more than two spell slots of your highest level and, if you can cast 2nd-level spells or higher, two spell slots of 1 level lower than your highest spell level. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<h3>Heightening Spells</h3>
<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they're heightened to certain levels.</p>
<h3>Cantrips</h3>
<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a magus. For example, as a 1st-level magus, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level magus, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>
<h3>Spellbook</h3>
<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of eight arcane cantrips and four 1st-level arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be anything from a sturdy book with a secure latch entitled Theses on the Stratagems of Supernatural Warfare to a tattered collection of training pamphlets with your name scrawled on the cover.</p>
<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two more arcane spells to your spellbook, of any level of spell you can cast. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures. Though you lose some lower spell slots as you increase in level, you keep the spells in your spellbook and can prepare them in your higher-level slots as normal.</p>
<p>If you have a spellbook from multiple sources (such as being a magus with the Wizard Dedication feat), you can use the same spellbook for all your spells.</p>

<h2>Spellstrike</h2>
<p>You've learned the fundamental magus technique that lets you combine magical and physical attacks together. You gain the Spellstrike activity.</p>
<h3>Spellstrike Specifics</h3>
<p>Though the base Spellstrike rules cover most spells, various modifications apply to more complicated spells when loaded into your fist, blade, or other attack.</p>
<p><strong>One Target:</strong> The spell targets only the target of your Strike, even if it normally allows more targets. Some feats let you affect more creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Reach:</strong> The coupled spell affects the target using the reach of the weapon or unarmed attack you make your Spellstrike with. For instance, shocking grasp would affect a creature beyond the reach of your hand if you used a weapon with reach, and ray of frost would affect only a creature in your weapon's reach, even though the spell's range is longer.</p>
<p><strong>Ancillary Effects</strong>: Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, acid splash would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target and tanglefoot's circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Defenses:</strong> Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save attempted by the target of a disintegrate spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it again on subsequent rounds would only combine a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later ones.</p>
<p><strong>Invalid or Immune Target:</strong> If the target you hit wouldn't be a valid target for the spell, the spell is still expended but doesn't affect the target. If the target is immune to your attack but not the spell, it can still be affected by the spell.</p>
<p><strong>Variable Actions:</strong> Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1- or 2-action version of the spell when you use Spellstrike. A spell has to take exactly 1 or 2 actions; you can't use Spellstrike with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 3 or more actions.</p>
<p><strong>Metamagic:</strong> You typically can't use metamagic with Spellstrike because metamagic requires the next action you take to be Cast a Spell, and Spellstrike is a combined activity that doesn't qualify.</p>
<h2>Arcane Cascade</h2>
<p>After you wield magic, you can enter a special stance to make your attacks more effective.</p>
<h2>Hybrid Study</h2>
<p>Your extensive physical training and carefully chosen magic combine to form a unique and dangerous fighting style that's more than the sum of its parts. You choose one field of hybrid study to represent your particular combination of skills. Your hybrid study gives you a special ability, usually tied to Spellstrike or Arcane Cascade, and it determines your initial conflux spell. The hybrid studies presented in this book are as follows.</p>
<h3>Inexorable Iron</h3>
<p>Once you begin along a path, nothing can stop you from reaching its end. You transform the mass of a greataxe, greatsword, or polearm into an unstoppable force to augment your own striking power or keep you standing on the battlefield. When you enter Arcane Cascade stance and at the start of each of your turns while you're in that stance, if you're wielding a melee weapon in two hands, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to half your level (minimum 1 temporary HP).</p>
<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> thunderous strike</p>
<h3>Laughing Shadow</h3>
<p>Magic is freeing, a means to your ends, and you can use it to go where you want, do as you please, and avoid the consequences. You are a laughing shadow of spell and blade, always one step ahead of your foes, always with a trick up your sleeve.</p>
<p>While in Arcane Cascade stance, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds, or a +10-foot bonus if you're unarmored. If you have a free hand while in the stance and are attacking a @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} creature, you increase the extra damage to 3, to 5 if you have weapon specialization, or to 7 if you have greater weapon specialization. You must have your other hand completely free; the extra damage doesn't apply if you have a free-hand weapon or other item in that hand, even if you would normally be able to use the hand for other things.</p>
<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> dimensional assault</p>
<h3>Sparkling Targe</h3>
<p>You've studied the applications of magic, training yourself to perform not just offensive maneuvers but defensive tactics as well. When magic flows through you, your shield can block impossible things, even a dragon's breath or a magic missile.</p>
<p>You gain the Shield Block general feat.</p>
<p>When you're in Arcane Cascade stance with your shield raised, your circumstance bonus to AC from your shield also applies to your saves against spells and other magical effects. In addition, damage you take as a result of a spell or magical effect while you're in Arcane Cascade can trigger your Shield Block reaction, even if the damage isn't physical. When blocking damage in this way, increase your shield's Hardness by an amount equal to the extra damage from Arcane Cascade (typically 1, but 2 if you have weapon specialization, or 3 if you have greater weapon specialization). These benefits apply whether you're using an actual shield, the shield spell, or something else that works like a shield (such as a raised tome if you have the Raise a Tome feat).</p>
<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> shielding strike</p>
<h3>Starlit Span</h3>
<p>With magic, the sky's the limit, and you can't be bound by the confines of physical proximity. Your power reaches as far as your senses can perceive, transcending the space between you and your target even with spells that normally require direct physical contact.</p>
<p>When you use Spellstrike, you can make a ranged weapon or ranged unarmed Strike, as long as the target is within the first range increment of your ranged weapon or ranged unarmed attack. You can deliver the spell even if its range is shorter than the range increment of your ranged attack.</p>
<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> shooting star</p>
<h3>Twisting Tree</h3>
<p>The staff is perhaps one of the simplest of weapons, but this simplicity belies its elegance and versatility. To you, a staff is casting implement and martial weapon alike-the foundation of a fighting style.</p>
<p>While you wield a staff in one hand, the staff adjusts in shape and weight, gaining the agile trait and increasing its damage die size to 1d6. While you wield a staff in both hands, it lengthens, twists, and reshapes, gaining the parry, reach, and trip traits. While you're in Arcane Cascade stance, you can Interact or Release to change your grip on the weapon as a free action when you Strike with your staff, including Strikes made in a Spellstrike. This happens before you roll your attack roll. You can also Interact to change your grip on the staff as a free action triggered at the end of your turn.</p>
<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> spinning staff</p>
<h2>Conflux Spells</h2>
<p>You learn a conflux spell from your hybrid study, and you can cast additional conflux spells by selecting certain feats. Conflux spells are magus-specific spells created for combat and are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to both study your spellbook and perform a physical regimen.</p>
<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points.</p>
<h2>Magus Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 2</span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a magus class feat.</p>
<h2>Skill Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 2</span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>
<h2>General Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>
<h2>Skill Increases<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>
<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>
<h2>Ability Boosts<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, boost four different ability scores. You can use these boosts to increase ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>
<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Weapon Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>
<h2>Studious Spells<span style="float: right;">Level 7</span></h2>
<p>Your hybrid study grants you additional spells that can enhance your power in combat. You gain two special 2nd-level studious spell slots, which can be used to prepare spider climb, true strike, water breathing, and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study. You add any spells from this class feature to your spellbook. At 11th level, the extra slots increase to 3rd level and you add haste and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study. At 13th level, the extra slots increase to 4th level and you add fly and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study.</p>
<p><strong>Laughing Shadow</strong> 7th: mirror image; 11th: shift blame; 13th: dimension door</p>
<p><strong>Sparkling Targe</strong> 7th: resist energy; 11th: warding aggression; 13th: stoneskin</p>
<p><strong>Starlit Span</strong> 7th: darkvision; 11th: wall of wind; 13th: freedom of movement</p>
<p><strong>Inexorable Iron</strong> 7th: enlarge; 11th: earthbind; 13th: dimensional anchor</p>
<p><strong>Twisting Tree</strong> 7th: magic mouth; 11th: slow; 13th: blink</p>
<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style="float: right;">Level 7</span></h2>
<p>You can inflict greater injuries with your favored weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>
<h2>Alertness<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>Your fundamental understanding of magic improves, making your spells harder to resist. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>
<h2>Resolve<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>
<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>You've learned to defend yourself better against incoming attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>
<h2>Weapon Mastery<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>
<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style="float: right;">Level 15</span></h2>
<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>
<h2>Juggernaut<span style="float: right;">Level 15</span></h2>
<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to a wide range of ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>
<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 17</span></h2>
<p>You fortify your spells with masterful prowess. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>
<h2>Medium Armor Mastery<span style="float: right;">Level 17</span></h2>
<p>Your skill with light and medium armor improves, increasing your ability to avoid blows. Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor, as well as for unarmed defense, increase to master.</p>
<h2>Double Spellstrike<span style="float: right;">Level 19</span></h2>
<p>You can extend the magic of spells you store with Spellstrike. After you make a Spellstrike with a spell cast from a spell slot, you retain an echo of the spell, stored in your body. The next time you Spellstrike, you can cast the same spell again without expending a spell slot.</p>
<p>If you choose to cast a different spell with Spellstrike, or you go 1 minute without using the stored spell, the stored spell dissipates harmlessly.</p>

<h1>Jouer un magus</h1>
<h2>Lors des rencontres de combat...</h2>
<p>Vous canalisez les sorts à travers votre arme ou votre corps pour frapper les ennemis avec une puissante combinaison d'attaque et de sort. Comme vos sorts quotidiens sont limités, vous vous fiez souvent à des tours de magie et des sorts de focalisation soigneusement choisis. Si nécessaire, vous savez comment gagner un combat sans magie.</p>
<h2>Lors des rencontres sociales...</h2>
<p>Du fait de votre éducation et de votre expérience élargie, vous êtes bien informé sur de nombreux sujets. Vous pouvez apporter des informations liées à vos recherches académiques, en particulier sur la magie.</p>
<h2>En exploration...</h2>
<p>Votre flexibilité vous permet de rechercher des auras magiques, de monter la garde et même de partir discrètement en éclaireur. Votre capacité à remplir différentes niches signifie que votre rôle dépend souvent des talents des autres membres de votre groupe.</p>
<h2>Pendant un intermède...</h2>
<p>Vous partagez votre temps entre les activités magiques, comme la recherche de sorts et la fabrication d'objets et la pratique martiale, comme le réapprentissage de capacités de combat pour apprendre de nouvelles techniques.</p>
<h2>Vous...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Affinez continuellement le choix de vos sorts et des objets pour les adapter à votre style personne, ou préparez des plans de bataille et des listes de sorts pour répondre à diverses situations.</li>
<li>fréquentez les érudits de la magie et les combattants chevronnés et cherchez des maîtres pour vous enseigner de nouvelles techniques.</li>
<li>Vous allez trop loin avec des plans ambitieux qui vous entraînent dans trop de directions à la fois.</li>

<h2>Ascendance et historique</h2>
<p>En plus des pouvoirs que votre classe vous accorde au niveau 1, vous bénéficiez des avantages de votre ascendance et de votre historique.</p>
<h2>Incantation arcanique</h2>
<p>Vous étudiez les sorts de sorte à pouvoir les combiner avec vos attaques ou à résoudre les problèmes que la seule force des bras ne peut surmonter. Vous pouvez lancer des sorts arcaniques en utilisant l'activité Lancer un sort et vous pouvez fournir les composantes matérielles, somatiques et verbales lorsque vous incantez les sorts. Comme vous êtes un magus, vous pouvez dessiner des symboles de remplacement avec la pointe de votre arme ou avec une main libre pour les sorts qui nécessitent des composantes matérielles, en remplaçant avec des composantes somatiques au lieu de devoir disposer d'une bourse à composantes.</p>
<p>Au niveau 1, vous pouvez préparer un sort de niveau 1 et cinq tours de magie tirés des sorts de votre grimoire. Les sorts préparés vous sont disponibles jusqu'à ce que vous les ayez lancés ou jusqu'à ce que vous fassiez de nouveau vos préparatifs quotidiens. Le nombre de sorts que vous pouvez préparer est représenté par vos emplacements de sort.</p>
<p>Quand vous gagnez des niveaux en tant que magus, votre nombre d’emplacements de sort et le niveau maximal des sorts à lancer depuis ces emplacements augmentent, comme indiqué dans le tableau des sorts de magus quotidiens ci-dessous.</p>
<p>Comme votre concentration se divise entre l'entraînement physique et les études magiques, vous n'avez pas plus de deux emplacements de sorts de votre plus haut niveau et si vous pouvez lancer des sorts de niveau 2 ou supérieur, deux sorts d'un niveau de moins que votre plus haut niveau de sort.</p>
<p>Certains sorts exigent un jet d’attaque de sort pour déterminer leur efficacité ou obligent vos ennemis à faire un jet contre leur DD (en général un jet de sauvegarde). Votre jet d’attaque de sort et votre DD de sort utilisent votre modificateur d’Intelligence.</p>
<h3><strong>Les sorts intensifiés</strong></h3>
<p>Quand vous obtenez des emplacements de sort de niveau 2 et plus, vous pouvez les remplir avec des versions plus puissantes de sorts de niveau inférieur. Cela augmente le niveau du sort, l’intensifiant pour qu’il corresponde à l’emplacement de sort. Nombre de sorts possèdent des améliorations spécifiques quand ils sont intensifiés à un niveau donné.</p>
<h3><strong>Les tours de magie</strong></h3>
<p>Un tour de magie est un type de sort qui n’utilise pas d’emplacement de sort. Il se lance à volonté chaque jour, aussi souvent que vous le désirez. Un tour de magie est toujours automatiquement intensifié jusqu’à la moitié de votre niveau arrondi à l’entier supérieur, donc généralement égal au sort de plus haut niveau que vous pouvez lancer en tant que magus. Par exemple, les tours de magie d’un magus de niveau 1 sont de niveau 1, tandis que ceux d’un magus de niveau 5 sont de niveau 3.</p>
<h3><strong>Le grimoire</strong></h3>
<p>Chaque sort arcanique possède une version écrite, normalement consignée dans un grimoire. Vous commencez avec un grimoire d’une valeur de 10 pa ou moins que vous recevez gratuitement et, chaque jour, vous devez l’étudier pour préparer vos sorts. Il contient un éventail de huit tours de magie arcaniques et quatre sorts arcaniques de niveau 1 de votre choix. Vous faites votre choix parmi les sorts courants de la liste des sorts arcaniques ou parmi d’autres sorts arcaniques auxquels vous avez accès. À vous de décider de la forme et du nom de votre grimoire. Cela pourrait aller d'un livre robuste avec un loquet sécurisé intitulé Thèses sur les stratagèmes de la guerre mystique à une collection de feuillets de formation en lambeaux avec votre nom griffonné sur la couverture.</p>
<p>À chaque fois que vous gagnez un niveau, vous ajoutez à votre grimoire deux sorts arcaniques de n’importe quel niveau que vous êtes capable de lancer. Vous pouvez aussi utiliser la compétence Arcanes pour lui ajouter d’autres sorts découverts au fil de vos aventures. Bien que vous perdiez certains de vos emplacements de sort lorsque vous augmentez de niveau, vous conservez les sorts dans votre grimoire et pouvez les préparer dans vos emplacements de sort de niveau supérieur, comme à l'ordinaire.</p>
<p>Si vous disposez d'un grimoire du fait de plusieurs sources (comme en étant un magus avec le don de dévouement de magicien), vous pouvez utiliser le même grimoire pour tous vos sorts.</p>

<h2>Frappe de sort</h2>
<p>Vous avez appris la technique fondamentale du magus qui vous permet de combiner les attaques magiques et physiques ensemble. Vous obtenez l'action Frappe de sort.</p>
<h3>Particularités de la frappe de sort</h3>
<p>Bien que la Frappe de sort de base corresponde à la plupart des sorts, des modifications variées s'appliquent à des sorts plus complexes lorsqu'ils sont chargés dans votre poing votre lame ou toute autre attaque.</p>
<p><strong>Une cible :</strong> Le sort n'affecte que la cible de votre Frappe, même s'il permettrait normalement d'affecter plus de cibles. Certains dons vous permettent d'affecter davantage de créatures.</p>
<p><strong>Allonge :</strong> Le sort couplé affecte la cible en utilisant la portée de votre arme ou de votre attaque à mains nues avec laquelle vous avez porté la Frappe de sort. Par exemple, Poigne électrique affectera une créature au-delà de la portée de votre main si vous avez utilisé une arme disposant d'une allonge et rayon de givre n'affectera qu'une créature à portée de votre arme même si la portée du sort est bien supérieure.</p>
<p><strong>Effets secondaires :</strong> Votre sort dispose toujours des effets non ciblés qui pourraient affecter des créatures autres que la cible, ainsi que tout autre effet qui se poursuit à partir du moment où votre frappe a touché. Par exemple, Aspersion acide infligera toujours des dégâts d'éclaboussure aux créatures autres que la cible et la pénalité de circonstances d'Entrave durera pendant sa durée normale. Le sort prend effet après que la Frappe a infligé ses dégâts ; si la Frappe a d'autres effets spéciaux, le MJ détermine s'ils se produisent avant ou après ceux du sort.</p>
<p><strong>Défenses multiples :</strong> Tout jet supplémentaire après l'attaque initiale du sort se produit normalement, comme le jet de Vigueur tentée par la cible d'un sort de Désintégration. De même, un sort qui vous permet d'attaquer à nouveau en l'utilisant lors des rounds suivants ne se combinera avec une Frappe qu'avec son jet d'attaque initial et non avec les suivants.</p>
<p><strong>Cible invalide ou immunisée :</strong> Si la cible que vous frappez ne devrait pas être une cible valide pour le sort, le sort est toujours dépensé mais n'affecte pas la cible. Si la cible est immunisée à votre attaque mais pas au sort, elle peut toujours être affectée par le sort.</p>
<p><strong>Actions variables :</strong> Certains sorts ont des effets différents en fonction du nombre d'actions que vous avez dépensé pour les lancer. Vous choisissez d'utiliser les effets d'une version à 1 ou 2 actions du sort lorsque vous faites une Frappe de sort. Un sort doit prendre exactement 1 ou 2 actions ; vous ne pouvez pas utiliser Frappe de sort avec un sort qui utilise une action gratuite, une réaction ou 3 actions ou plus.</p>
<p><strong>Métamagie :</strong> Vous ne pouvez pas typiquement utiliser de métamagie avec Frappe de sort car la métamagie nécessite que l'action suivante que vous devez entreprendre consiste à Lancer un sort et Frappe de sort est une activité combinée qui ne permet pas de remplir cette condition.</p>
<h2>Cascade arcanique</h2>
<p>Après avoir manié la magie, vous pouvez adopter une posture spéciale pour rendre vos attaques plus efficaces. Vous obtenez l'action Cascade arcanique.</p>
<h2>Études hybridées</h2>
<p>Votre entraînement physique intense et votre magie soigneusement choisie se combinent pour former un style de combat unique et dangereux qui est bien plus que la somme de ses deux aspects. Vous choisissez un champ d'études hybridées pour représenter cette  combinaison particulière de compétences. Vos études hybridées vous donnent droit à une capacité spéciale, habituellement liée à Frappe de sort ou à Cascade arcanique et qui détermine votre sort de confluence initial. Les études hybridées sont les suivantes.</p>
<h3>Acier inexorable</h3>
<p>Une fois que vous empruntez un chemin, rien ne peut vous arrêter jusqu'à ce que vous ayez atteint son terme. Vous transformez la masse d'une grande hache, d'une épée à deux mains ou d'une arme d'hast en une force imparable pour augmenter votre propre puissance de frappe ou vous garder debout sur le champ de bataille.</p>
<p>Lorsque vous entrez dans la posture de Cascade arcanique et au début de chacun de vos tours tant que vous conservez cette posture, si vous maniez une arme de corps-à-corps à deux mains, vous obtenez des Points de Vie temporaires égaux à la moitié de votre niveau (1 pv temporaire au minimum).</p>
<p><strong>Sort de confluence</strong> <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.r82rqcm0MmGaBFkM]{Frappe tonitruante}</em></p>
<h3>Arbre tordu</h3>
<p>Le bâton est peut-être une des armes les plus simples, mais cette simplicité contredit son élégance et sa polyvalence. En ce qui vous concerne, un bâton est un accessoire d'incantation autant qu'une arme de guerre - le fondement d'un style de combat.</p>
<p>Lorsque vous maniez un bâton dans une main, le bâton ajuste sa forme et son poids et obtient le trait agile en augmentant la taille de son dé de dégâts qui passe à 1d6. Lorsque vous maniez le bâton avec vos deux mains, il s'agrandit et se reforme, obtenant les traits parade, allonge et croc-en-jambe. Lorsque vous êtes dans la posture Cascade arcanique, vous pouvez Interagir ou le Lâcher pour changer votre prise sur l'arme par une action gratuite lorsque vous Frappez avec votre bâton, incluant les Frappes faites lors d'une Frappe de sort. Cela se produit avant que vous ne lanciez le jet d'attaque. Vous pouvez aussi Interagir pour changer la prise sur votre bâton par une action gratuite déclenchée à la fin de votre tour.</p>
<p><strong>Sort de confluence</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.KAapTzGKJMbMQCL1]{Bâton tournoyant}</p>
<h3>Ombre ricanante</h3>
<p>La magie est libératrice, un moyen de parvenir à vos fins, et vous pouvez l'utiliser pour aller où vous voulez, faire ce qui vous plaît et éviter les conséquences. Vous êtes une ombre ricanante de sort et de lame, toujours un pas devant vos adversaires, toujours avec un atout dans votre manche.</p>
<p>Lorsque vous adoptez la posture Cascade arcanique, vous obtenez un bonus de statut de +1,5 m à vos Vitesses ou un bonus de +3 m si vous ne portez pas d'armure. Si vous disposez d'une main libre lorsque vous êtes dans cette posture et que vous attaquez une créature @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Prise au dépourvu}, vous augmentez les dégâts supplémentaires à 3, à 5 si vous disposez de spécialisation martiale ou à 7 si vous disposez de la spécialisation martiale supérieure. Vous devez avoir votre autre main complètement libre ; les dégâts supplémentaires ne s'appliquent pas si vous avez une arme permettant de disposer d'une main libre ou un autre objet dans cette main, même si vous devriez normalement être capable d'utiliser la main pour faire d'autres choses.</p>
<p><strong>Sort de confluence</strong> <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.5p9Y4ACrtRM4gTpN]{Assaut dimensionnel}</em></p>
<h3>Portée des étoiles</h3>
<p>Avec la magie, le ciel est la limite et vous ne pouvez être lié aux contingences de la proximité physique. Votre puissance se déploie aussi loin que vos sens peuvent percevoir, transcendant l'espace entre vous et votre cible, même avec les sorts qui nécessiteraient normalement un contact physique direct.</p>
<p>Lorsque vous utilisez Frappe de sort, vous pouvez faire une Frappe avec une arme à distance ou une Frappe à main nue à distance, tant que la cible est dans le premier Facteur de portée de votre arme à distance ou de votre attaque à mains nues à distance. Vous pouvez délivrer le sort même si sa portée est plus courte que le Facteur de portée de votre attaque à distance.</p>
<p><strong>Sort de confluence</strong> <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.nVfP43Xbs6I1PO8v]{Étoile tirée}</em></p>
<h3>Targe étincelante</h3>
<p>Vous avez étudié les applications de la magie et vous êtes entraîné à ne pas seulement accomplir des manœuvres offensives mais aussi à déployer des tactiques défensives. Lorsque la magie coule à travers vous, votre bouclier peut bloquer des choses impossibles, même le souffle d'un dragon ou un projectile magique.</p>
<p>Vous obtenez le don général @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.jM72TjJ965jocBV8]{Blocage au bouclier}.</p>
<p>Lorsque vous êtes dans la Posture Cascade arcanique avec votre bouclier levé, votre bonus de circonstances à la CA de votre bouclier s'applique aussi à vos jets de sauvegarde contre les sorts et autres effets magiques. De plus, les dégâts que vous subissez qui sont le résultat d'un sort ou d'un effet magique tant que vous êtes en Cascade arcanique peuvent déclencher votre réaction Blocage au bouclier, même si les dégâts ne sont pas physiques. Lorsque vous bloquez les dégâts de cette manière, augmentez la Solidité de votre bouclier par un montant égal aux dégâts supplémentaires de l'activité Cascade arcanique (typiquement de 1, mais de 2 si vous disposez de spécialisation martiale ou de 3 si vous disposez de spécialisation martiale supérieure). Ces avantages s'appliquent lorsque vous utilisez un bouclier, le sort <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.TVKNbcgTee19PXZR]{Bouclier}</em> ou quelque chose d'autre qui fonctionne comme un bouclier (comme un livre si vous avez le don @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.JoxEspM0kbCop7og]{Interposer un livre}).</p>
<p><strong>Sort de confluence</strong> <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.53NqGTJOf4LcjVyD]{frappe bouclier}</em></p>
<h2>Sorts de confluence</h2>
<p>Vous apprenez un sort de confluence avec vos études hybridées et vous pouvez lancer des sorts de confluence supplémentaires en choisissant certains dons. Les sorts de confluence sont des sorts spécifiques aux magus et créés pour le combat et sont un type de sorts de focalisation. Il faut dépenser 1 Point de Focalisation pour lancer un sort de focalisation et vous débutez avec une réserve de focalisation de 1 Point de Focalisation. Vous remplissez votre réserve de focalisation au cours de vos préparatifs quotidiens  et vous pouvez regagner 1 Point de Focalisation en dépensant 10 minutes en utilisant l'activité Refocaliser en étudiant votre grimoire et en accomplissant une activité physique.</p>
<p>Les sorts focalisés sont automatiquement intensifiés à la moitié de votre niveau arrondi au supérieur. Les sorts de focalisation ne nécessitent pas d'emplacement de sort et vous ne pouvez pas les lancer en utilisant des emplacements de sort. Prendre des dons peut vous donner plus de points de focalisation et augmenter la taille de votre réserve de focalisation, bien que cette dernière ne puisse jamais contenir plus de 3 points.</p>
<h2>Dons de magus<span style="float: right;"> Niveau 2</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 2 et tous les niveaux pairs par la suite, vous obtenez un don de classe de magus.</p>
<h2>Dons de compétences<span style="float: right;"> Niveau 2</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 2, puis tous les deux niveaux, vous gagnez un don de compétence. Ces dons disposent du trait compétence. Pour choisir un don de compétence, vous devez être au moins qualifié dans la compétence correspondante.</p>
<h2>Dons généraux<span style="float: right;">Niveau 3</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 3, puis tous les quatre niveaux, vous gagnez un don général.</p>
<h2>Améliorations de compétence<span style="float: right;">Niveau 3</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 3, puis tous les deux niveaux, vous gagnez une amélioration de compétence. Vous pouvez utiliser cette amélioration pour devenir qualifié dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes inexpérimenté, ou pour devenir expert dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes déjà qualifié.</p>
<p>Vous pouvez utiliser les améliorations de compétence que vous obtenez au niveau 7 ou plus pour devenir maître dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes expert et les améliorations de compétence que vous obtenez au niveau 15 ou plus pour devenir légendaire dans une compétence dans laquelle vous êtes maître.</p>
<h2>Primes de caractéristiques<span style="float: right;">Niveau 5</span></h2>
<p>Au niveau 5, puis tous les cinq niveaux, vous améliorez quatre caractéristiques différentes. Vous pouvez utiliser ces primes de caractéristique pour faire passer une valeur de caractéristique au-dessus de 18. La prime augmente la valeur de caractéristique de 1 si elle est déjà de 18 ou plus ou de 2 si elle est inférieure à 18.</p>
<h2>Dons ancestraux<span style="float: right;">Niveau 5</span></h2>
<p>Vous gagnez un don ancestral au niveau 5 puis tous les quatre niveaux, en plus de celui avec lequel vous avez commencé.</p>
<h2>Réflexes fulgurants<span style="float: right;">Niveau 5</span></h2>
<p>Vos réflexes sont fulgurants. Votre rang de maîtrise pour les jets de Réflexes passe à expert.</p>
<h2>Expertise avec les armes<span style="float: right;">Niveau 5</span></h2>
<p>Vous vous êtes consacré à l'apprentissage des subtilités de vos armes. Votre rang de maîtrise avec les armes simples, les armes de guerre et les attaques à mains nues passe à expert.</p>
<h2>Sorts studieux<span style="float: right;">Niveau 7</span></h2>
<p>Vos études hybridées vous accordent des sorts supplémentaires qui peuvent améliorer votre puissance en combat. Vous obtenez deux emplacements de sorts spéciaux de niveau 2 qui peuvent être utilisés pour préparer Pattes d'araignée, Coup au but, Respiration aquatique ainsi qu'un sort supplémentaire qui dépend de vos études hybridées. Vous ajoutez tout sort de cette capacité de classe à votre grimoire.</p>
<p>Au niveau 11, les emplacements de sort passent au niveau 3 et vous ajoutez Rapidité et un sort supplémentaire dépendant de vos études hybridées.</p>
<p>Au niveau 13, les emplacements supplémentaires passent au niveau 4 et vous ajoutez Vol et un sort supplémentaire qui dépend de vos études hybridées.</p>
