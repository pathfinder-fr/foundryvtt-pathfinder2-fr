------ Description (en) ------
<p><em>While some fear projectile weapons, you savor the searing flash, wild kick, and cloying smoke that accompanies a gunshot, or snap of the cable and telltale thunk of your crossbow just before your bolt finds purchase. Ready to draw a bead on an enemy at every turn, you rely on your reflexes, steady hand, and knowledge of your weapons to riddle your foes with holes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Ability: DEXTERITY</strong></p>
<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Dexterity.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>
<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>
<h1>Roleplaying the Gunslinger</h1>
<h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2>
<p>You strike from range with your firearms, seeking to defeat your opponents before they can pose a true threat. Depending on your choice of weapon, you might prefer to strike your opponent from a hidden position before they ever realize you're there, dash through a frenzied melee with pistols blazing, or glide effortlessly across the battlefield, waiting for the perfect moment to end the conflict with a single, well-placed shot.</p>
<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>
<p>You have a keen eye and can see things coming from farther than most. You might not be the life of the party, but your companions know to pay attention when your subtle nod or concerned grunt indicates that something's amiss.</p>
<h2>While Exploring...</h2>
<p>You scout the group's position for incoming threats and help search for secret doors and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} passages, keeping a weather eye out for unexpected threats.</p>
<h2>In Downtime...</h2>
<p>You might craft ammunition or keep your complex weapons clean and maintained, and you might look for work that matches your unique talents, such as working as a blacksmith, engineer, or part of the local watch. You might wander from town to town, or stay put for a spell to enjoy the silence that lingers between gunfights.</p>
<h2>You Might...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Seek out areas of great conflict where your unique choice of weaponry can help build your reputation.</li>
<li>Explore new horizons, trusting your honed senses and deadly weapon to keep you safe.</li>
<li>Demonstrate extensive knowledge about various types of guns and ammunition, along with curiosity about the latest in gun technology.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Others Probably...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Assume that since you know how your gun works, you must also understand how to resolve other mechanical challenges.</li>
<li>Underestimate you at first glance, thinking you rely on your gun because you lack any other skills.</li>
<li>Respect your eternal vigilance, unyielding grit, and excellent aim.</li>

<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>
<p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>
<h2>Gunslinger's Way</h2>
<p>All gunslingers have a particular way they follow, a combination of philosophy and combat style that defines both how they fight and the weapons they excel with. At 1st level, your way grants you an initial deed, a unique reload action called a slinger's reload, and proficiency with a particular skill. You also gain advanced and greater deeds at later levels, as well as access to way-specific feats. The gunslinger ways are described in detail on page 108. The following ways are presented in this book.</p>
<p><strong>Way of the Drifter:</strong> You wander across the battlefield, equally at home in and out of the fray.</p>
<p><strong>Way of the Pistolero:</strong> You carefully maintain your distance at a duelist's 10 paces with pistol in hand.</p>
<p><strong>Way of the Sniper:</strong> You practice a methodical style of shooting, striking from far cover.</p>
<p><strong>Way of the Vanguard:</strong> You rely on a brutal combat style that uses heavy weapons and explosive attacks.</p>
<h2>Gunslinger Feats</h2>
<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a gunslinger class feat.</p>
<h2>Singular Expertise</h2>
<p>You have particular expertise with guns and crossbows that grants you greater proficiency with them and the ability to deal more damage. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage rolls with firearms and crossbows.</p>
<p>This intense focus on firearms and crossbows prevents you from reaching the same heights with other weapons. Your proficiency with unarmed attacks and with weapons other than firearms and crossbows can't be higher than trained, even if you gain an ability that would increase your proficiency in one or more other weapons to match your highest weapon proficiency (such as the weapon expertise feats many ancestries have). If you have gunslinger weapon mastery, the limit is expert, and if you have gunslinging legend, the limit is master.</p>
<h2>Skill Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 2</span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>
<h2>General Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>
<h2>Skill Increases<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>
<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>
<h2>Stubborn<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>You don't like being told what to do, and you don't give up. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert. When you fail, but don't critically fail, a Will save against an effect that would give you the controlled condition, you can attempt a second save against the effect at the start of your next turn. On a successful second save, the controlled condition ends, though any other effects remain. As normal, failing this second save doesn't allow you to attempt a third save on the subsequent turn.</p>
<h2>Ability Boosts<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>
<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
<h2>Gunslinger Weapon Mastery<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>You fully understand the best way to utilize your unique weapons. Your proficiency rank increases to master with simple and martial firearms and crossbows. Your proficiency rank for advanced firearms and crossbows, simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert.

<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style="float: right;">Level 7</span></h2>
<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>
<h2>Advanced Deed<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>You've learned a powerful new technique of your chosen way. You gain the advanced deed ability of the way you chose at 1st level.</p>
<h2>Gunslinger Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>Your special shots become harder for opponents to predict or resist. Your proficiency rank for your gunslinger class DC increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Evasion<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>
<h2>Gunslinging Legend<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>You've learned unique techniques for wielding firearms and crossbows that give you unmatched skill in their use. Your proficiency rank increases to legendary with simple and martial firearms and crossbows and to master with advanced firearms and crossbows. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>

<h2>Greater Deed<span style="float: right;">Level 15</span></h2>
<p>You've mastered the pinnacle technique of your chosen way. You gain the greater deed ability of the way you chose at 1st level.</p>
<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style="float: right;">Level 15</span></h2>
<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>
<h2>Juggernaut<span style="float: right;">Level 17</span></h2>
<p>Your body has become accustomed to physical hazards and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>
<h2>Shootist's Edge<span style="float: right;">Level 17</span></h2>
<p>You make shots others find impossible. Your proficiency rank for your gunslinger class DC increases to master. When using a ranged weapon in which you have master or greater proficiency, you ignore the penalty for attacking within the weapon's second and third range increments.</p>
<h2>Incredible Senses<span style="float: right;">Level 19</span></h2>
<p>You notice things that most people can't detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>
<h2>Medium Armor Mastery<span style="float: right;">Level 19</span></h2>
<p>Your skill with light and medium armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge or absorb blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to master.</p>
