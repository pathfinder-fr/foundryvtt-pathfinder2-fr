------ Description (en) ------
<p><em>Deities work their will upon the world in infinite ways, and you serve as one of their most stalwart mortal servants. Blessed with divine magic, you live the ideals of your faith, adorn yourself with the symbols of your church, and train diligently to wield your deity's favored weapon. Your spells might protect and heal your allies, or they might punish foes and enemies of your faith, as your deity wills. Yours is a life of devotion, spreading the teachings of your faith through both word and deed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Ability: WISDOM</strong></p>
<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>
<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>
<h1>Roleplaying the Cleric</h1>
<h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2>
<p>If you're a warpriest, you balance between casting spells and attacking with weapons- typically the favored weapon of your deity. If you're a cloistered cleric, you primarily cast spells. Most of your spells can boost, protect, or heal your allies. Depending on your deity, you get extra spells to heal your allies or harm your enemies.</p>
<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>
<p>You might make diplomatic overtures or deliver impressive speeches. Because you're wise, you also pick up on falsehoods others tell.</p>
<h2>While Exploring...</h2>
<p>You detect nearby magic and interpret any religious writing you come across. You might also concentrate on a protective spell for your allies in case of attack. After a battle or hazard, you might heal anyone who was hurt.</p>
<h2>In Downtime...</h2>
<p>You might perform services at a temple, travel to spread the word of your deity, research scripture, celebrate holy days, or even found a new temple.</p>
<h2>You Might...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Visit the temples and holy places sacred to your faith, and have an immediate affinity with other worshippers of your deity.</li>
<li>Know the teachings of your religion's holy texts and how they apply to a dilemma.</li>
<li>Cooperate with your allies, provided they don't ask you to go against divine will.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Others Probably...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Find your devotion impressive, even if they don't understand it.</li>
<li>Expect you to heal their wounds.</li>
<li>Rely on you to interact with other religious figures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>
<p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>
<h2>Deity</h2>
<p>As a cleric, you are a mortal servitor of a deity you revere above all others. Your alignment must be one allowed by your deity, as listed in their entry. Your deity grants you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with the deity's favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon.</p>
<p>Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. You can prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell list, once you can prepare spells of their level as a cleric. Some of these spells aren't normally on the divine list, but they're divine spells if you prepare them this way.</p>
<p>A list of all deities can be found in the Deities compendium.</p>
<h3><strong>Anathema</strong></h3>
<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>
<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, or if your alignment changes to one not allowed by your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine font and all divine spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.7Fd4lxozd11MQ55N]{Atone}</em> ritual.</p>
<h2>Divine Font</h2>
<p>Through your deity's blessing, you gain additional spells that channel either the life force called positive energy or its counterforce, negative energy. When you prepare your spells each day, you can prepare additional <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.rfZpqmj0AIIdkVIs]{Heal}</em> or <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.wdA52JJnsuQWeyqz]{Harm}</em> spells, depending on your deity. The divine font spell your deity provides is listed in the Divine Font entry for your deity; if both are listed, you can choose between <em>heal</em> or <em>harm</em>. Once you choose, you can't change your choice short of an ethical shift or divine intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Healing Font</strong> You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only <em>heal</em> spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Harmful Font</strong> You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only <em>harm</em> spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier.</p>
<h2>Divine Spellcasting</h2>
<p>Your deity bestows on you the power to cast divine spells. You can cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a cleric, you can usually hold a divine focus (such as a religious symbol) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a spell component pouch.</p>
<p>At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list in this book or from other divine spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>
<p>As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3-9: Cleric Spells per Day.</p>
<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier.</p>
<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>
<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>
<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>
<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a cleric. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level cleric, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>

<h2>Doctrine</h2>
<p>Even among followers of the same deity, there are numerous doctrines and beliefs, which sometimes vary wildly between clerics. At 1st level, you select a doctrine and gain the benefits of its first doctrine. The doctrines presented in this book are cloistered cleric and warpriest. Each doctrine grants you initial benefits at 1st level. At 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, you gain the benefits granted by your doctrine's second, third, fourth, fifth, and final doctrines respectively.</p>
<p>Doctrines can be found here (@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ZZzLMOUAtBVgV1DF]{Cloistered Cleric} and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.0Aocw3igLwna9cjp]{Warpriest}).</p>
<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>

<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>
<h2>Miraculous Spell<span style="float: right;">Level 19</span></h2>
<p>You're exalted by your deity and gain truly incredible spells. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using divine spellcasting.

<h1>Jouer un prêtre</h1>
<h2>Lors des rencontres de combat...</h2>
<p>Si vous êtes un prêtre combattant, vous alternez incantations de sorts et attaques armées, le plus souvent avec l’arme de prédilection de votre divinité. Si vous êtes un prêtre cloîtré, vous privilégiez l’incantation de sorts. La plupart de vos sorts stimulent, protègent ou soignent vos alliés. En fonction de votre divinité, vous obtenez des sorts supplémentaires pour soigner vos alliés ou blesser vos ennemis.</p>
<h2>Lors des rencontres sociales...</h2>
<p>Vous pouvez faire des propositions diplomatiques ou des discours marquants. Grâce à votre sagesse élevée, vous sentez aussi lorsque les autres manquent de franchise.</p>
<h2>En exploration...</h2>
<p>Vous détectez la magie à proximité et interprétez les écrits religieux que vous découvrez. Vous pouvez également rester concentré sur un sort qui protège vos alliés en cas d’attaque. Après un combat ou une embûche, vous pouvez soigner tous les blessés.</p>
<h2>Pendant un intermède...</h2>
<p>Vous pouvez mener des offices dans un temple, voyager pour répandre la parole de votre divinité, étudier des écrits sacrés, célébrer les jours saints ou même fonder un nouveau temple.</p>
<h2>Vous...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Visitez les temples et les sites sacrés de votre religion et avez une affinité immédiate avec les autres fidèles de votre divinité,</li>
<li>Connaissez les enseignements des textes sacrés de votre religion et savez comment les appliquer en cas de dilemme,</li>
<li>Coopérez avec vos alliés, à condition qu’ils ne vous demandent pas d’agir contre la volonté de votre divinité.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Les autres...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Trouvent votre dévotion impressionnante, même s’ils ne la comprennent pas,</li>
<li>S’attendent à ce que vous soigniez leurs blessures,</li>
<li>Comptent sur vous pour que vous interagissiez avec les autres individus religieux.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ascendance et historique</h2>
<p>En plus des capacités que votre classe vous accorde au niveau 1, vous bénéficiez des avantages de votre ascendance et de votre historique.</p>
<h2>Divinité</h2>
<p>En tant que prêtre, vous êtes le serviteur mortel d’une divinité que vous vénérez en priorité. Le panthéon vous donne accès à des divinités avec leurs alignements, leurs domaines d’intérêt et les avantages conférés aux prêtres de chacune d’elles. Votre alignement doit être l’un de ceux autorisés par votre divinité, comme indiqué dans la rubrique correspondante. Votre divinité vous octroie le rang de maîtrise qualifié dans une compétence et dans le maniement de son arme de prédilection. Vous avez accès à l’arme de prédilection si celle-ci est peu courante.</p>
<p>Votre divinité ajoute également des sorts à votre liste de sorts. Vous pouvez les préparer comme n’importe quel autre sort de votre liste de sorts divins dès que votre niveau de prêtre est suffisant pour les préparer. Certains de ces sorts ne font normalement pas partie de la liste des sorts divins, mais on les considère comme tels si vous les préparez de cette façon.</p>
<p>La liste des divinités est accessible dans le compendium des divinités.</p>
<h3><strong>Anathème</strong></h3>
<p>Les actions fondamentalement opposées aux idéaux et à l’alignement de votre divinité sont anathèmes à votre religion. Vous n’êtes plus dans les bonnes grâces de votre divinité si vous apprenez ou lancez des sorts, commettez des actes ou utilisez des objets anathèmes à votre dieu.</p>
<p>L’incantation de sorts avec le trait mauvais est presque toujours anathème aux divinités d’alignement bon, tout comme l’incantation de sorts avec le trait bon est anathème aux divinités d’alignement mauvais, l’incantation de sorts chaotiques aux divinités d’alignement loyal et l’incantation de sorts loyaux aux divinités chaotiques. Un prêtre neutre qui vénère une divinité neutre n’est pas limité de la sorte, mais son alignement peut changer au fil du temps s’il lance souvent des sorts ou utilise des pouvoirs associés à un alignement en particulier. De la même façon, l’incantation de sorts anathèmes aux préceptes ou objectifs de votre foi peut interférer avec la relation que vous entretenez avec votre divinité. Par exemple, l’incantation d’un sort pour créer un mort-vivant est anathème à Pharasma, la déesse de la mort. Dans les cas limites, c’est vous et le MJ qui déterminez quels agissements sont anathèmes.</p>
<p>Si vous accomplissez trop d’actes anathèmes à votre divinité ou si votre alignement change et qu’il n’est pas autorisé par votre dieu, vous perdez les pouvoirs magiques conférés par votre relation avec votre divinité. Les capacités de classe que vous perdez sont déterminées par le MJ, mais il est probable que vous perdiez votre source divine et votre capacité d’incantation de sorts divins. Vous ne pouvez récupérer ces capacités que si vous montrez un réel désir de repentance en accomplissant un rituel de <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.7Fd4lxozd11MQ55N]{Pénitence}</em>.</p>
<h2>Source divine</h2>
<p>Grâce aux bénédictions de votre divinité, vous obtenez des sorts supplémentaires qui canalisent la force de vie appelée énergie positive, ou son opposée l’énergie négative. Quand vous préparez vos sorts chaque jour, vous pouvez préparer des sorts de <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.rfZpqmj0AIIdkVIs]{Guérison}</em> ou de <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.wdA52JJnsuQWeyqz]{Mise à mal}</em> supplémentaires, en fonction de votre divinité. Le sort de la source divine conféré par votre divinité est indiqué dans la rubrique Source divine de votre divinité ; si les deux sont indiqués, vous choisissez entre <em>Guérison</em> ou <em>Mise à mal</em>. Une fois ce choix fait, vous ne pouvez plus en changer, sauf en cas de changement d’éthique ou d’intervention divine.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source de guérison</strong> vous obtenez chaque jour des emplacements de sort de prêtre supplémentaires d’un niveau égal au plus élevé auquel vous avez déjà accès. Vous ne pouvez préparer que des sorts de <em>Guérison</em> avec ces emplacements dont le nombre est égal à 1 plus votre modificateur de Charisme.</li>
<li><strong>Source de mise à mal</strong> vous obtenez chaque jour des emplacements de sort de prêtre supplémentaires d’un niveau égal au plus élevé auquel vous avez déjà accès. Vous ne pouvez préparer que des sorts de <em>Mise à mal</em> avec ces emplacements dont le nombre est égal à 1 plus votre modificateur de Charisme.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Incantation divine</h2>
<p>Votre divinité vous accorde le pouvoir de lancer des sorts divins. Vous lancez des sorts divins avec l’activité Lancer un sort et pouvez fournir des composants matériels, somatiques et verbaux lors de l’incantation. Étant donné que vous êtes un prêtre, vous pouvez normalement brandir un focaliseur divin (tel qu’un symbole religieux) pour lancer les sorts nécessitant des composants matériels au lieu d’utiliser une bourse de composants.</p>
<p>Au niveau 1, vous pouvez chaque matin préparer deux sorts de niveau 1 et cinq tours de magie que vous choisissez parmi les sorts courants de la liste des sorts divins ou parmi les autres sorts divins auxquels vous avez accès. Vos sorts restent à votre disposition jusqu’à ce que vous les lanciez ou que vous les prépariez de nouveau. Le nombre de sorts que vous pouvez préparer est représenté par vos emplacements de sort.</p>
<p>Au fur et à mesure que vous gagnez des niveaux de prêtre, le nombre de sorts que vous pouvez préparer chaque jour augmente, tout comme le niveau de sort le plus élevé que vous pouvez lancer, comme indiqué sur la table des Sorts de prêtre quotidiens ci-après.</p>
<p>Certains sorts exigent un jet d’attaque de sort pour déterminer leur efficacité ou obligent vos ennemis à faire un jet contre le DD de votre sort (en général un jet de sauvegarde). Comme la Sagesse est votre caractéristique essentielle, vos jets d’attaque de sort et le DD de vos sorts utilisent votre modificateur de Sagesse.</p>
<h3><strong>Les sorts intensifiés</strong></h3>
<p>Quand vous obtenez des emplacements de sort de niveau 2 et plus, vous pouvez les remplir avec des versions plus puissantes de sorts de niveau inférieur. Cela augmente le niveau du sort, l’intensifiant pour qu’il corresponde à l’emplacement de sort. Nombre de sorts possèdent des améliorations spécifiques quand ils sont intensifiés à un niveau donné.</p>
<h3><strong>Les tours de magie</strong></h3>
<p>Un tour de magie est un type de sort qui n’utilise pas d’emplacement de sort. Il se lance à volonté chaque jour, aussi souvent que vous le désirez. Un tour de magie est toujours automatiquement intensifié jusqu’à la moitié de votre niveau arrondi à l’entier supérieur, donc généralement égal au sort de plus haut niveau que vous pouvez lancer en tant que prêtre. Par exemple, les tours de magie d’un prêtre de niveau 1 sont de niveau 1, tandis que ceux d’un prêtre de niveau 5 sont de niveau 3.</p>
