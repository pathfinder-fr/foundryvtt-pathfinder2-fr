Name: Wizard
Nom: Magicien
État: officielle

------ Description (en) ------
<p><em>You are an eternal student of the arcane secrets of the universe, using your mastery of magic to cast powerful and devastating spells. You treat magic like a science, cross-referencing the latest texts on practical spellcraft with ancient esoteric tomes to discover and understand how magic works. Yet magical theory is vast, and there's no way you can study it all. You either specialize in one of the eight schools of magic, gaining deeper understanding of the nuances of those spells above all others, or favor a broader approach that emphasizes the way all magic comes together at the expense of depth.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Ability: INTELLIGENCE</strong></p>
<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>
<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>
<h1>Roleplaying the Wizard</h1>
<h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2>
<p>You likely try to stay out of the fray, carefully judging when to use your spells. You save your most powerful magic to incapacitate threatening foes and use your cantrips when only weaker foes remain. When enemies pull out tricks like <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.XXqE1eY3w3z6xJCB]{Invisibility}</em> or <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.A2JfEKe6BZcTG1S8]{Fly}</em>, you answer with spells like <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.0qaqksrGGDj74HXE]{Glitterdust}</em> or <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gPvtmKMRpg9I9D7H]{Earthbind}</em>, leveling the field for your allies.</p>
<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>
<p>You provide a well of knowledge about arcane matters and solve arguments with logic.</p>
<h2>While Exploring...</h2>
<p>You locate magical auras and determine the arcane significance of magical writing or phenomena you uncover. When you run across an unusual obstacle to further exploration, you probably have a scroll that will make it easier to overcome.</p>
<h2>In Downtime...</h2>
<p>You learn new spells, craft magic items, or scribe scrolls for your party, and seek out new and exciting formulas in addition to spells. You might even forge scholarly connections and establish a school or guild of your own.</p>
<h2>You Might...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have an unquenchable intellectual curiosity about how everything in the world around you works-magic in particular.</li>
<li>Believe fervently that your school of magic is superior (if you're a specialist) or that true mastery of magic requires knowledge of all schools (if you're a universalist).</li>
<li>Use esoteric jargon and technical terms to precisely describe the minutiae of magical effects, even though the difference is probably lost on other people.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Others Probably...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider you to be incredibly powerful and potentially dangerous.</li>
<li>Fear what your magic can do to their minds, bodies, and souls, and ask that you avoid casting spells in polite company, as few can identify whether one of your spells is harmless or malevolent until it's too late.</li>
<li>Assume you can easily solve all their problems, from dangerous weather to poor crop yields, and ask you for spells that can help them get whatever they desire.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1>
<p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way.</p>
<h2>Perception</h2>
<p>Trained in Perception</p>
<h2>Saving Throws</h2>
<p>Trained in Fortitude</p>
<p>Trained in Reflex</p>
<p>Expert in Will</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>Trained in Arcana</p>
<p>Trained in a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier</p>
<h2>Attacks</h2>
<p>Trained in the club, crossbow, dagger, heavy crossbow, and staff</p>
<p>Trained in unarmed attacks</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Untrained in all armor</p>
<p>Trained in unarmored defense</p>
<h2>Spells</h2>
<p>Trained in arcane spell attacks</p>
<p>Trained in arcane spell DCs</p>

<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>
<p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>
<h2>Arcane Bond</h2>
<p>You place some of your magical power in a bonded item. Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item. This is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. You gain the Drain Bonded Item free action.</p>
<h3>@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.v82XtjAVN4ffgVVR]{Drain Bonded Item} <span class="pf2-icon">F</span></h3>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You haven't acted yet on your turn</p>
<hr />
<p>You expend the power stored in your bonded item. During your turn, you gain the ability to cast one spell you prepared today and already cast, without spending a spell slot. You must still Cast the Spell and meet the spell's other requirements.</p>
<h2>Arcane School</h2>
<p>Many arcane spellcasters delve deeply into a single school of magic in an attempt to master its secrets. If you want to be a specialist wizard, choose a school in which to specialize. You gain additional spells and spell slots for spells of your school.</p>
<p>If you don't choose a school, you're a universalist, a wizard who believes that the path to true knowledge of magic requires a multidisciplinary understanding of all eight schools working together. Though a universalist lacks the focus of a specialist wizard, they have greater fiexibility.</p>
<p>Arcane schools can be found here (@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.gCwcys8CnS102tji]{Arcane School: Abjuration}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.SNeVaUBTHwvoO6kr]{Arcane School: Conjuration}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.yobGgrHdgjs5QW5o]{Arcane School: Divination}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ZHwGACWQEy6kTzcP]{Arcane School: Enchantment}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ibhml5y20g5M3Vgd]{Arcane School: Evocation}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.K6hG7nH8yjmbA0Q9]{Arcane School: Illusion}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.uNM7qZQokRKAEd7k]{Arcane School: Necromancy}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.rHxkPijLnQ9O9AGV]{Arcane School: Transmutation} and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.qczCKdg47eAmCOUD]{Arcane School: Universalist})</p>
<h2>Arcane Spellcasting</h2>
<p>Through dedicated study and practice, you can harness arcane power to cast spells. You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells.</p>
<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), plus one extra cantrip and spell of your chosen school of each level you can cast if you are a specialist wizard. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>
<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 3-19: Wizard Spells per Day.</p>
<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>
<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>
<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>
<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a wizard. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>
<h3><strong>Spellbook</strong></h3>
<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-level arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Crimson Libram</em>, or something more academic, like <em>A Field Study in Practical Transmutation</em>.</p>
<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any level for which you have spell slots. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures.</p>

<h2>Arcane Thesis</h2>
<p>During your studies to become a full-fledged wizard, you produced a thesis of unique magical research on one of a variety of topics. You gain a special benefit depending on the topic of your thesis research. The arcane thesis topics presented in this book are below; your specific thesis probably has a much longer and more technical title like "On the Methods of Spell Interpolation and the Genesis of a New Understanding of the Building Blocks of Magic."</p>
<p>Arcane thesis can be found here @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.M89l9FOnjHe63wD7]{Arcane Thesis}.</p>
<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>
<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>
<h2>Skill Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 2</span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>
<h2>Wizard Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 2</span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a wizard class feat.</p>
<h2>General Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>
<h2>Skill Increases<span style="float: right;">Level 3</span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>
<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>
<h2>Ability Boosts<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>
<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style="float: right;">Level 5</span></h2>
<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 7</span></h2>
<p>Extended practice of the arcane has improved your capabilities. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>
<h2>Magical Fortitude<span style="float: right;">Level 9</span></h2>
<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Alertness<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Wizard Weapon Expertise<span style="float: right;">Level 11</span></h2>
<p>Through a combination of magic and training, you've learned how to wield wizard weapons more effectively. You gain expert proficiency in the club, crossbow, dagger, heavy crossbow, staff, and unarmed attacks.</p>
<h2>Defensive Robes<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>The flow of magic and your training combine to help you avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>
<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style="float: right;">Level 13</span></h2>
<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>
<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 15</span></h2>
<p>You command superlative spellcasting ability. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>
<h2>Resolve<span style="float: right;">Level 17</span></h2>
<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>
<h2>Archwizard's Spellcraft<span style="float: right;">Level 19</span></h2>
<p>You command the most potent arcane magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using arcane spellcasting. You can't use this spell slot for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots. Unlike with other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.tP26mgaFPpr6df1i]{Archwizard's Might} feat to gain a second slot.</p>
<h2>Legendary Spellcaster<span style="float: right;">Level 19</span></h2>
<p>You are a consummate spellcaster, with a comprehensive understanding of both arcane theory and practical spellcraft. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>
------ Description (fr) ------
<p><em>Vous êtes un éternel étudiant des secrets arcaniques de l’univers et utilisez votre maîtrise de la magie pour lancer de puissants sorts dévastateurs. Vous considérez la magie comme une science et comparez les dernières publications sur la pratique des sorts avec d’anciens volumes ésotériques afin de découvrir et comprendre comment fonctionne la magie. Mais la théorie magique est un vaste sujet et il est impossible de l’étudier dans son ensemble. Vous êtes spécialisé dans l’une des huit écoles de magie et comprenez mieux les nuances de ses sorts que de ceux des autres écoles, ou vous privilégiez une approche plus généraliste qui se concentre sur la manière dont tous les sorts s’unissent plutôt que d’étudier un seul sujet en profondeur.</em></p>
<p><strong>Caractéristique essentielle: INTELLIGENCE</strong></p>
<p>Au niveau 1, votre classe vous donne une prime de caractéristique à l’Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Points de vie : 6 plus votre modificateur de Constitution</strong></p>
<p>Vous augmentez votre maximum de PV de ce montant au niveau 1, puis à chaque fois que vous gagnez un niveau.</p>
<h1>Jouer un magicien</h1>
<h2>Lors des rencontres de combat...</h2>
<p>Vous essayez probablement de rester loin de la mêlée et de trouver le meilleur moment pour utiliser vos sorts. Vous conservez votre magie la plus puissante pour mettre de redoutables adversaires hors de combat et utilisez vos tours de magie quand il ne reste que de faibles adversaires. Quand des ennemis se rendent invisibles ou s’envolent, vous répondez par des sorts comme <em>Poussière scintillante</em> ou <em>Cloué à terre</em> mettant ainsi vos alliés au même niveau.</p>
<h2>Lors des rencontres sociales...</h2>
<p>Vous êtes un puits de connaissances en matière d’arcanes et réglez les disputes par la logique.</p>
<h2>En exploration...</h2>
<p>Vous repérez les auras magiques et déterminez la signification arcanique des écrits magiques ou des phénomènes que vous découvrez. Quand un obstacle inhabituel vous empêche de progresser, vous disposez sûrement du parchemin idéal pour le surmonter plus facilement.</p>
<h2>Durant les intermèdes...</h2>
<p>Vous apprenez de nouveaux sorts, fabriquez des objets magiques ou rédigez des parchemins pour votre groupe. Vous cherchez de nouvelles formules excitantes en plus de vos sorts. Vous pouvez nouer des relations avec des érudits ou même créer votre propre école ou guilde.</p>
<h2>Vous...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pouvez avoir une insatiable curiosité intellectuelle et chercher à comprendre le fonctionnement de tout ce qui vous entoure, en particulier la magie.</li>
<li>Pouvez être intimement convaincu que votre école de magie est la meilleure (si vous êtes un spécialiste) ou qu’il faut connaître toutes les écoles pour maîtriser vraiment la magie (si vous êtes un universaliste).</li>
<li>Pouvez utiliser un jargon ésotérique et des termes très techniques pour décrire précisément les détails des effets magiques, bien que ces précisions échappent probablement à la majorité des gens.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Les autres...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Considèrent probablement que vous êtes incroyablement puissant et potentiellement dangereux.</li>
<li>Craignent probablement ce que votre magie peut faire à leur esprit, leur corps et leur âme et vous demandent sûrement d’éviter de lancer des sorts en bonne compagnie, car peu de gens sont capables de les identifier et de savoir s’ils sont inoffensifs ou maléfiques avant qu’il ne soit trop tard.</li>
<li>Pensent probablement que vous pouvez résoudre facilement tous leurs problèmes, qu’il s’agisse d’une météo dangereuse ou de récoltes trop maigres, et vous demandent des sorts pour les aider à obtenir ce qu’ils veulent.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Maîtrises initiales</h1>
<p>Au niveau 1, vous gagnez les rangs de maîtrise indiqués pour les statistiques suivantes. Vous êtes inexpérimenté pour tout ce qui ne figure pas ci‑dessous, à moins d’obtenir un rang de maîtrise supérieur d’une autre manière.</p>
<h2>Perception</h2>
<p>Qualifié en Perception</p>
<h2>Jets de sauvegarde</h2>
<p>Qualifié en Vigueur</p>
<p>Qualifié en Réflexes</p>

<h2>Compétences</h2>
<p>Qualifié en Arcanes</p>
<p>Qualifié dans un nombre de compétences supplémentaire égal à 2 plus votre modificateur d’Intelligence</p>
<h2>Attaques</h2>
<p>Qualifié avec le gourdin, l'arbalète, la dague, l'arbalète lourde, et le bâton</p>
<p>Qualifié en attaques à mains nues</p>

<p>Qualifié pour la défense sans armure</p>
<h2>Sorts</h2>
<p>Qualifié pour les attaques de sort arcanique</p>
<p>Qualifié pour le DD des sorts arcaniques</p>

<p>En plus des pouvoirs que votre classe vous accorde au niveau 1, vous bénéficiez des avantages de votre ascendance et de votre historique</p>
<h2>Lien arcanique</h2>
<p>Vous placez une partie de votre puissance magique dans un objet lié. Chaque jour lorsque vous préparez vos sorts, vous pouvez désigner un unique objet en votre possession comme votre objet lié. Il s’agit en général d’un objet associé à l’incantation, comme une baguette, un anneau ou un bâton, mais vous êtes libre de choisir une arme ou autre chose. Vous gagnez l’action gratuite Drain d’objet lié</p>
<h3>@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.v82XtjAVN4ffgVVR]{Drain d'objet lié} <span class="pf2-icon">F</span></h3>
<p><strong>Fréquence</strong> une fois par jour<br /><strong>Conditions</strong> Vous n'avez pas encore agi à votre tour</p>
<hr />
<p>Vous dépensez la puissance contenue dans votre objet lié, ce qui vous permet de lancer, sans dépenser d’emplacement, un sort que vous avez préparé pour la journée et déjà lancé. Vous devez tout de même Lancer le sort et remplir ses autres conditions.</p>
<h2>École arcanique</h2>
<p>Nombre d’incantateurs arcaniques se plongent dans l’étude d’une unique école de magie pour essayer de maîtriser ses secrets. Si vous désirez devenir un magicien spécialisé, choisissez une école de prédilection. Vous gagnez des sorts et emplacements de sort supplémentaires pour les sorts de votre école.</p>
<p>Si vous ne choisissez pas d’école, vous êtes un universaliste, un magicien persuadé que le chemin de la connaissance exige une approche pluridisciplinaire de la magie et l’étude du fonctionnement conjoint des huit écoles de magie. Un universaliste n’est pas aussi pointu dans un domaine qu’un magicien spécialisé, mais il dispose de plus de flexibilité.</p>
<p>Les différentes écoles arcaniques sont les suivantes : (@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.gCwcys8CnS102tji]{Abjuration}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.yobGgrHdgjs5QW5o]{Divination}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ZHwGACWQEy6kTzcP]{Enchantement}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ibhml5y20g5M3Vgd]{Évocation}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.K6hG7nH8yjmbA0Q9]{ Illusion}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.SNeVaUBTHwvoO6kr]{Invocation}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.uNM7qZQokRKAEd7k]{Nécromancie}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.rHxkPijLnQ9O9AGV]{Transmutation} et @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.qczCKdg47eAmCOUD]{Universaliste})</p>
<h2>Incantation arcanique</h2>
<p>À force d’études et de pratique, vous pouvez puiser dans la puissance arcanique pour lancer des sorts. Vous lancez des sorts arcaniques avec l’activité Lancer un sort et pouvez fournir des composants matériels, somatiques et verbaux lors de l’incantation</p>
<p>Au niveau 1, vous pouvez préparer chaque matin jusqu’à deux sorts de niveau 1 et cinq tours de magie issus de votre grimoire (voir plus loin), plus un tour de magie et un sort de votre école de prédilection de chaque niveau que vous pouvez lancer si vous êtes un magicien spécialisé. Vos sorts restent à votre disposition jusqu’à ce que vous les lanciez ou que vous les prépariez de nouveau. Le nombre de sorts que vous pouvez préparer est représenté par vos emplacements de sort.</p>
<p>Quand vous gagnez des niveaux en tant que magicien, votre nombre d’emplacements de sort et le niveau maximal des sorts à lancer depuis ces emplacements augmentent, comme indiqué dans le tableau des sorts de magicien quotidiens ci-dessous.</p>
<p>Certains sorts exigent un jet d’attaque de sort pour déterminer leur efficacité ou obligent vos ennemis à faire un jet contre leur DD (en général un jet de sauvegarde). Comme l’Intelligence est votre caractéristique essentielle, vos jets d’attaque de sort et vos DD utilisent votre modificateur d’Intelligence.</p>
<h3><strong>Les sorts intensifiés</strong></h3>
<p> Quand vous obtenez des emplacements de sort de niveau 2 et plus, vous pouvez les remplir avec des versions plus puissantes de sorts de niveau inférieur. Cela augmente le niveau du sort, l’intensifiant pour qu’il corresponde à l’emplacement de sort. Nombre de sorts possèdent des améliorations spécifiques quand ils sont intensifiés à un niveau donné.</p>
<h3><strong>Les tours de magie</strong></h3>
<p>Un tour de magie est un type de sort qui n’utilise pas d’emplacement de sort. Il se lance à volonté chaque jour, aussi souvent que vous le désirez. Un tour de magie est toujours automatiquement intensifié jusqu’à la moitié de votre niveau arrondi à l’entier supérieur, donc généralement égal au sort de plus haut niveau que vous pouvez lancer en tant que magicien. Par exemple, les tours de magie d’un magicien de niveau 1 sont de niveau 1, tandis que ceux d’un magicien de niveau 5 sont de niveau 3.</p>
<h3><strong>Le grimoire</strong></h3>
<p>Chaque sort arcanique possède une version écrite, normalement consignée dans un grimoire. Vous commencez avec un grimoire d’une valeur de 10 pa ou moins que vous recevez gratuitement et, chaque jour, vous devez l’étudier pour préparer vos sorts. Il contient un éventail de 10 tours de magie arcaniques et cinq sorts arcaniques de niveau 1 de votre choix. Vous faites votre choix parmi les sorts courants de la liste des sorts arcaniques ou parmi d’autres sorts arcaniques auxquels vous avez accès. À vous de décider de la forme et du nom de votre grimoire. Ce peut être un livre moisi à la reliure de cuir ou un ensemble de minces disques de métal glissés sur un anneau d’airain. Son nom peut être ésotérique, comme <em>le Libram cramoisi</em> ou plus académique, comme <em>Études de terrain de la transmutation appliquée.</em></p>
<p>À chaque fois que vous gagnez un niveau, vous ajoutez à votre grimoire deux sorts arcaniques de n’importe quel niveau que vous êtes capable de lancer. Vous pouvez aussi utiliser la compétence Arcanes pour lui ajouter d’autres sorts découverts au fil de vos aventures.</p>
