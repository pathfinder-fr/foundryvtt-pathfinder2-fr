<p><strong>[Slotless]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Tier 1 with the Vigilant Seal</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 Fame</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: Pathfinders don't always find adventure on their own; they often need someone to lead them to where the danger lies. As their guide on perilous treks, your renown grows. When you GM an adventure that grants at least 4 XP, you earn 2 additional Fame and Reputation with the Vigilant Seal faction. You can qualify for the benefit when you run multiple adventures that grant fewer XP so long as the total XP at least equals 4.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: You can benefit from this boon only a number of times equal to your current Reputation Tier with the Vigilant Seal faction. Each time you fulfill the requirements of this boon, mark it on your Chronicle sheet along with the associated Reputation Tier. You can only earn additional Fame and Reputation with this boon for one character per adventure you run, even if you have multiple characters who could benefit from this boon.</p>
