<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Tier 1 with the Horizon Hunters</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 Fame</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: It's not enough to simply see the world; you're driven to experience local cultures' unfamiliar customs, too. When you play a Pathfinder Adventure Card Society scenario or a Starfinder Society scenario, you earn 2 additional Fame and Reputation with the Horizon Hunters faction on the next scenario you play.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: You can benefit from this boon only a number of times equal to your current Reputation Tier with the Horizon Hunters faction. Each time you fulfill the requirements of this boon, mark it on your Chronicle sheet along with the associated Reputation Tier. Have the GM sign beside this notation. You can only earn additional Fame and Reputation with this boon for one character per scenario played, even if you have multiple characters who could benefit from this boon.</p>
