<p><strong>Effect</strong>: Even when your careful searching doesn’t uncover all of a site’s valuables, you’re able to appraise, repair, and certify what you did recover to maximize their value. You can purchase this boon at the end of a scenario when you and your allies recovered 9 or fewer of the adventure’s Treasure Bundles. Increase the effective number of Treasure Bundles recovered by 1 for the purpose of calculating the group’s gold piece rewards. For each addition 2 points of Fame you spend when purchasing this boon, you increase the effective number of Treasure Bundles recovered by 1.</p>
<p>The total number of additional Treasure Bundles provided by this boon cannot exceed the number of Treasure Bundles the group actually recovered, nor can this boon increase the number of Treasure Bundles beyond the scenario’s maximum.</p>
