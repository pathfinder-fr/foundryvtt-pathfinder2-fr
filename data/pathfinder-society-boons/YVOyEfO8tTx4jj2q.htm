<p>You vanquished the spirits of Warlock's Barrow, and now through some quirk of fate, you can call upon them to help you lay other undead to rest.</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: Two Actions</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: The purified waters of Warlock's Barrow surround your weapons, now harming the undead instead of the living. You cast disrupting weapons as a 1st-level innate spell, except the spell also has the water trait.</p>
