<p><strong>Effect</strong>: While working with less experienced Pathfinder allies, you provide key spellcasting insights that augment your colleagues' magic. Any PCs benefiting from a Level Bump and whose levels are lower than yours can prepare one additional spell of their highest-level spell slot or cast one additional spell of their highest-level spell slot. When casting spells of a magical tradition that is the same as the tradition you use for spellcasting, the affected PC also increases the Level Bump's modifier to spell DCs to 2.</p>
<p><strong>Normal</strong>: A Level Bump increases a PC's spell DCs by 1, and it does not grant any additional spells prepared or spell slots.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: A PC can only benefit from two mentor boons.</p>
