<p><strong>[Item]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Tier 2 with the Grand Archive; You own a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.gbwr57aT9ou8yKWT]{Wayfinder}</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 2 Fame</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: Free Action</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: You have modified your @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.gbwr57aT9ou8yKWT]{Wayfinder} to focus your mental energy, driving more reliable insights. When you slot this boon, you apply its benefits to one @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.gbwr57aT9ou8yKWT]{Wayfinder} in your possession, granting you a special free action ability when the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.gbwr57aT9ou8yKWT]{Wayfinder} is invested and in your possession.</p>
<p>You can activate this ability as a free action before you Recall Knowledge. If you roll a critical failure on the Recall Knowledge check, you instead get a failure.</p>
<p>You can safely use this benefit once per adventure. You can attempt to use it a second time, overcharging the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.gbwr57aT9ou8yKWT]{Wayfinder} at the risk of destroying it. When you do so, roll a DC 10 flat check. On a success, the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.gbwr57aT9ou8yKWT]{Wayfinder} is broken. On a failure, the <em>wayfinder</em> is destroyed. If anyone tries to overcharge a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.gbwr57aT9ou8yKWT]{Wayfinder} that's already been overcharged, the item is automatically destroyed (even if it has been repaired) and does not provide the activated benefit.</p>
