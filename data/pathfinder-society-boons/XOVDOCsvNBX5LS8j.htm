<p><strong>Effect</strong>: Valais Durant is the leader of the Radiant Oath, in no small part because of her kindness and willingness to share her power with those in need. You may check a box next to this boon and spend an action to use the champion focus spell @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.zNN9212H2FGfM7VS]{Lay on Hands}, heightened appropriately for your level. This does not cost a focus point.</p>
