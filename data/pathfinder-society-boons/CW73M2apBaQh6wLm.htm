<p><strong>[Slotless]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Tier 4 with the Grand Archive</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 8 Fame</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: Through a combination of your own research and the access to rare resources through the Grand Archive, you have identified an exceptional research opportunity-one that you can't decipher on your own. You have recruited a promising new agent to help research and publish your findings, which gives your assistant an extraordinary edge in their training.</p>
<p>When you purchase this boon, select one of your Pathfinder Society characters with 12 or fewer XP who is not a field commissioned agent. That character gains one additional point to assign to their school training, for a total of 4 points.</p>
