------ Description (en) ------
<p>The creature takes a -4 status penalty to Stealth checks for 5 minutes or until it spends a 3-action activity, which has the manipulate trait, to remove the glitter. The glitter continues to fall around the creature until completely removed, leaving a trail behind it as it moves and revealing its rough location; the creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden}, rather than @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected}, to any creature that can see the glitter whenever it would otherwise have been undetected.</p>
