Name: (Vampire, Vetalarana, Basic) Mental Rebirth
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Unlike most other undead, a vetalarana isn't destroyed when they reach 0 HP. Instead, their body is destroyed, crumbling to ash, and their mind is immediately transferred into a creature they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts. This creature must be within 1 mile; if no such creature is in range, the vetalarana is destroyed. The creature becomes controlled by the vetalarana and loses the stupefied and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} conditions. If the creature controlled by a vetalarana in this way is killed, the vetalarana's mind transfers to another creature within 1 mile who they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts.</p>
<p>After [[/r 1d6 #days]]{1d6 days} of being controlled, the controlled creature dies, and its body transforms into that of the vetalarana who rendered it comatose.</p>
