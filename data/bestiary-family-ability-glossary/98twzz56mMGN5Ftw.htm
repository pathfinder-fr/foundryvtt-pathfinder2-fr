------ Description (en) ------
<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Requirements</strong> The vrykolakas' last action was a successful fangs Strike;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The vrykolakas sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1} (@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 2} if a vrykolakas master uses this action), and the vrykolakas regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire, but it increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.</p>
<p>The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful <span data-pf2-check="medicine" data-pf2-label="Blood Transfusion DC" data-pf2-dc="20" data-pf2-show-dc="gm">Medicine</span> check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.</p>
