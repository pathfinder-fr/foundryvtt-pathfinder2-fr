------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> A @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.VcDeM8A5oI6VqhbM]{Restrained}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}, or willing creature is within the vetalarana's reach;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The vetalarana seizes a creature and consumes its memories. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 1} {@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 2} on a critical success), and the vetalarana regains HP equal to 10% of the vetalarana's maximum HP, gaining any excess as temporary Hit Points. Draining Thoughts from a creature that is already stupefied doesn't restore any HP to the vetalarana but increases the victim's stupefied value by 1. Additionally, the vetalarana views one of the victim's memories. The vetalarana manipulator can choose to alter, enhance, or erase the memory they view as a 4th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.FhOaQDTSnsY7tiam]{Modify Memory}</em> spell.</p>
<p>A victim's stupefied condition value decreases by 1 every week.</p>
<p>A victim that becomes stupefied 5 in this way is rendered comatose, becoming permanently @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}. As long as the vetalarana lives, a comatose victim can't regain consciousness, and its stupefied condition doesn't decrease.</p>
