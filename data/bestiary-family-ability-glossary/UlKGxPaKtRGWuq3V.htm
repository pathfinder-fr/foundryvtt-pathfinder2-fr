------ Description (en) ------
<p>A divine warden always wields its patron deity's favored weapon. If the weapon is a ranged weapon, the divine warden automatically generates new ammunition with each attack. For a divine warden of 4th level or higher, the deity's favored weapon gains the effects of a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.DxCuJKynlnMQZHgp]{Striking}</em> rune while the divine warden wields it; at 12th level, these effects are of a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.KCQRFvUgbyclvOGi]{Greater Striking}</em> rune, and at 19th level, they're instead of a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.woxl2FrrgAcJDu0t]{Major Striking}</em> rune.</p>
