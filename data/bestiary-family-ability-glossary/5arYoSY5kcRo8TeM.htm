------ Description (en) ------
<p>Vrykolakas all have the following vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Burial Site Bound</strong> A vrykolakas is bound to the place of its death or interment. It must return to this location once per week and bury itself in the earth for 24 hours, during which time it is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed} and can be beheaded. If it is unable to return to this site, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and attempts to use Feral Corruption; if this host animal can't return to the burial site before the possession effect ends, the vrykolakas is destroyed and the animal host returns to normal.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerable to Decapitation</strong> A vrykolakas that is beheaded can't use its Feral Possession, and a beheaded corpse cannot rise as a vrykolakas.</li>
</ul>
