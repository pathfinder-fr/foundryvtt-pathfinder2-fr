Name: (Vampire, True) Dominate
Nom: 
État: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>The vampire can cast <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.OsOhx3TGIZ7AhD0P]{Dominate}</em> at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses the DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.</p>
