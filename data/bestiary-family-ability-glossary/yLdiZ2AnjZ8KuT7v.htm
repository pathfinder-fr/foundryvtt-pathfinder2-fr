<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The skeleton transforms into a cyclone of bones, taking up the same space, but twice as tall. It then Strides up to double its Speed. It can move through spaces occupied by other creatures, and this movement doesn't trigger reactions. Creatures the bone storm moves through take [[/r {1d6}[slashing]]]{1d6 slashing damage} for every 2 levels of the skeleton, with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:|basic:true] save against the hard DC for the creature's level. A level 1 or lower skeleton only moves; it doesn't deal damage. A creature attempts this save only once even if the bone storm moved through its space multiple times. At the end of the movement, the skeleton reforms.</p>
