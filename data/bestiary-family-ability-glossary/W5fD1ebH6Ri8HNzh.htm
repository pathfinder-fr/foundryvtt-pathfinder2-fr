------ Description (en) ------
<p>The graveknight can gift a piece of its armor to a willing ally, which becomes its grave squire.</p>
<p>The graveknight can communicate telepathically with its squire at any distance, see through the squire's senses, and cast <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.qwlh6aDgi86U3Q7H]{Suggestion}</em> as a divine innate spell through the telepathic link at will; the squire treats its degree of success as one step worse.</p>
<p>If the graveknight's main armor is destroyed, the squire's piece expands to cover the squire's body over [[/br 1d10 #days]]{1d10 days}, after which point it becomes the graveknight's new body.</p>
<p>The graveknight can have only one squire at a time, and must recover the gifted piece of armor if it wishes to create a new squire.</p>
