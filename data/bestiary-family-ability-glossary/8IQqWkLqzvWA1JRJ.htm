Name: (Vampire, Strigoi Progenitor) Create Spawn
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Essence or Domain of Dusk, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights.</p>
<p>If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(10+@actor.data.data.saves.will.value)|name:Escape Thralldom] saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.</p>
<p>A victim that is 8th level or higher becomes a strigoi servant, while a lower-level victim instead becomes a moroi vampire</p>
