------ Description (en) ------
<p>The zombies work in groups to rip foes to pieces. Whenever a zombie with this ability successfully @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.PMbdMWc2QroouFGD]{Grapples} a foe that's already @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.VcDeM8A5oI6VqhbM]{Restrained} by another zombie with this ability, they violently struggle over the poor victim, dealing fist damage (or a similar Strike's damage if the zombie doesn't have a fist Strike). If the grapple is a critical success, the target takes double damage and ceases being grabbed or restrained by any other creatures. If the zombie has the @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Tkd8sH4pwFIPzqTr]{Grab} ability, using Grab deals half its fist Strike damage to the target.</p>
