------ Description (en) ------
<p>When the divine warden is reduced to 0 HP, it erupts with divine energy in a 30-foot emanation, dealing [[/r {1d6}]]{1d6 damage} per level. This damage is either positive or negative, determined by the patron deity's divine font (chosen at the divine warden's creation if the deity offers a choice), and this ability gains the corresponding trait. Each creature in the area must attempt a Will save with the following outcomes.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature takes half damage.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes full damage.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes full damage and becomes temporarily cursed by the patron deity. The creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled 1} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 1} for 1 day; this is a curse effect that uses the Will save DC as the counteract DC.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except the creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled 2} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 2}.</p>
