<p>The zombie emits an aura of rot and disease that causes wounds to fester and turn sour.</p>
<p>Any living creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the zombie and is not at full Hit Points takes [[/r {1d6}]]{1d6 damage} as its wounds fester. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 6 levels the zombie has.</p>
<p>Creatures that take a critical hit from the zombie also take this damage immediately.</p>
