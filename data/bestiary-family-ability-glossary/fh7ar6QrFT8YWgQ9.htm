------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> A @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.VcDeM8A5oI6VqhbM]{Restrained}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}, or willing creature is within the strigoi's reach</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The strigoi progenitor sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood and draw out its vital essence. This requires an @Check[type:athletics] check against the creature's Fortitude DC if the creature is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 2} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 2}, and the strigoi regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any HP, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of).</p>
<p>A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful @Check[type:medicine|dc:20] check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.</p>
<p>A victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations. If the daily preparations are done in full sunlight, the stupefied condition is removed entirely.</p>
