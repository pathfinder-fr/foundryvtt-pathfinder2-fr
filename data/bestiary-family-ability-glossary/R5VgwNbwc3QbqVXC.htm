<p><strong>Effect</strong> The strigoi uses Shadow Form. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the strigoi is unaffected by further damage. Once the strigoi reaches its coffin, or if it hasn't done so within 2 hours, it automatically returns to its physical form, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}.</p>
