------ Description (en) ------
<p>Unlike other undead, a jiang-shi isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they fall @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} and awaken in 1 minute with 1 Hit Point. Scattering at least 1 Bulk of glutinous rice or hen eggs on an unconscious jiang-shi destroys them permanently. If the jiang-shi was reduced to 0 HP by an attack from a weapon made of darkwood, they're destroyed immediately.</p>
