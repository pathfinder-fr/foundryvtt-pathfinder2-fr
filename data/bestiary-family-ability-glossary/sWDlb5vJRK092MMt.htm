<p><strong>Effect</strong> The vetalarana manipulator spends 10 minutes to take psychic control of the creatures they've rendered comatose with Drain Thoughts. This has the effects of the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.wU6hNzK8Yfqdmc8m]{Possession}</em> spell, but lasts for up to 6 hours, has a range of 1 mile, and the vetalarana can control a number of comatose victims at a time equal to half the vetalarana's level. A comatose victim can't resist this possession and automatically gets a critical failure on its saving throw against Control Comatose.</p>
<p>As long as a comatose victim is controlled by a vetalarana manipulator in this way, the victim's stupefied and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} conditions are temporarily suppressed.</p>
