------ Description (en) ------
<p>The vrykolakas can cast <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.OsOhx3TGIZ7AhD0P]{Dominate}</em> at will as a divine innate spell that affects only animals. The save DC is a high DC for the vrykolakas's level, and a creature that succeeds is immune to that vrykolakas's Dominate Animal for 24 hours. Destroying the vrykolakas ends the effect, but reducing it to 0 HP does not.</p>
<p>A dominated animal takes a -4 circumstance penalty to saving throws against the vrykolakas's Feral Possession.</p>
