Name: (Graveknight) Empty Save for Dust
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>The graveknight's armor contains nothing more than swirling dust that puffs out from joints in their armor. A living creature that touches or is touched by the graveknight (including one hit by the graveknight's fist Strike) must succeed at a @Check[type:reflex|dc:] saving throw or become contaminated with the dust. While contaminated, the targeted creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 1} and gains weakness to the graveknight's energy damage equal to half the graveknight's level. The contamination ends after 1 minute or when the creature is doused with water, whichever occurs first.</p>
