------ Description (en) ------
<p>The ghost extends some of its nature to one or more undead of equal or lower level, who are connected to the ghost's story and unfinished business.</p>
<p>These undead gain the ghost's @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-family-ability-glossary.unR8VVR4yyRnsmnB]{Rejuvenation} ability and can't be permanently destroyed so long as the ghost exists. If the ghost is laid to rest, all linked undead are likewise instantly destroyed.</p>
<p>Linked undead often, but not always, share the ghost's @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-family-ability-glossary.BcSlVpaN72LoQ5BV]{Site Bound} ability as well. The ghost doesn't have any control over such undead, and indeed the ghost and their partners in eternity may be unremittingly hostile to one another.</p>
