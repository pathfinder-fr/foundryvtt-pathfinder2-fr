Living creatures in this area take [[/r {1d6}[negative]]]{1d6 negative damage} +1d6 per 2 levels possessed by the strigoi (@Check[type:fortitude|dc:|basic:true] save against the DC of the strigoi's level). A creature that fails this save is also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} for 1 round (or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} for 1 round and then dazzled for 1 round)</p>
