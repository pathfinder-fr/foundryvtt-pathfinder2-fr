Name: (Lich) Aura of Rot
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>The lich is surrounded by pervasive, supernatural rot. Unattended food and drink within 30 feet of the lich immediately spoils. Anyone attempting to eat or drink within this area must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} as the sustenance spoils before it can be ingested (ruining potions and other magical food and drink). Ordinary plants that remain within this aura for more than 1 minute wither and begin to die (depending on their size, this might take significantly longer).</p>
