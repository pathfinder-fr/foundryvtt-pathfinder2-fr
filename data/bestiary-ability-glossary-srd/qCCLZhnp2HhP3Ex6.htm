------ Description (en) ------
<p>A monster with darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only. Some forms of magical darkness, such as a 4th-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.4GE2ZdODgIQtg51c]{Darkness} spell, block normal darkvision. A monster with greater darkvision, however, can see through even these forms of magical darkness.</p>
