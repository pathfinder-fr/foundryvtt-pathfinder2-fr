<p><strong>Trigger </strong>A creature within the monster&rsquo;s reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it&rsquo;s using.</p>
<p><strong>Effect </strong>The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature.

This Strike doesn&rsquo;t count toward the monster&rsquo;s multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn&rsquo;t apply to this Strike.</p>
