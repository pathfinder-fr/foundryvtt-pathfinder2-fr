------ Description (en) ------
<p>The monster can use @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Tkd8sH4pwFIPzqTr]{Grab} as a free action triggered by a hit with its initial attack. A monster with Improved Grab still needs to spend an action to extend the duration for creatures it already has @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{grabbed}.</p>
