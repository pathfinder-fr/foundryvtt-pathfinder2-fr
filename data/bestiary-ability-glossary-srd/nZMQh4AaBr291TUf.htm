------ Description (en) ------
<p>Most monsters that serve as mounts can attempt to buck off unwanted or annoying riders, but most mounts will not use this reaction against a trusted creature unless the mounts are spooked or mistreated.</p>
<p><strong>Trigger </strong>A creature @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.PM5jvValFkbFH3TV]{mounts} or uses the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.q9nbyIF0PEBqMtYe]{Command an Animal} action while riding the monster.</p>
<p><strong>Effect </strong>The triggering creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw against the listed DC or fall off the creature and land @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{prone}. If the save is a critical failure, the triggering creature also takes [[/roll 1d6]] bludgeoning damage in addition to the normal damage for the fall.</p>
