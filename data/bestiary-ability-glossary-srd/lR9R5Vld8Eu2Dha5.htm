------ Description (en) ------
<p>This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{dying} condition never increases beyond dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to dying 4.</p>
