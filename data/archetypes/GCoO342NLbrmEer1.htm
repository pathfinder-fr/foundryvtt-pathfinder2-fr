<h1>Bounty Hunter</h1>
<p>Whether for coin, glory, or justice, you know how to track, defeat, and capture dangerous individuals. You&rsquo;re accustomed to perusing wanted posters, searching up on leads, and pursuing villains to hell and back.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Feats</strong>: 14th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.pbD4lfAPkK1NNag0]{Double Prey} (Core Rulebook 175)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.tKaesXO5nlZ2sspx]{Bounty Hunter Dedication} Feat 2</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Survival</p>
<hr />
<p>When focused on finding your quarry, you&rsquo;re relentless. You gain the Hunt Prey action (Core Rulebook 168). You can use Hunt Prey to designate only a creature that you&rsquo;ve seen, heard about, or learned about through some other means, such as a bounty board or wanted poster. In addition to the other benefits of Hunt Prey, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to Gather Information regarding your prey.</p>
<p>If you already have Hunt Prey, you become an expert in Survival and gain the circumstance bonus to Gather Information about your prey; you can still designate a creature you&rsquo;re tracking during exploration, in addition to the conditions above.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can&rsquo;t select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the bounty hunter archetype.</p>
<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.mRHkGMLecd5aaj2R]{Tools Of The Trade} Feat 4</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re well-versed in weapons that allow you to bring bounties in alive. You are trained with the following weapons: bola (page 248), sap, and whip. You gain access to bolas. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the weapons listed.</p>
<p>In addition, you take no penalty when making a nonlethal attack with a weapon without the nonlethal trait.</p>
<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.N0YcU8mIJnQ4C2N6]{Posse} Feat 4</h2>
<p><strong>Requirements </strong>You have designated prey with Hunt Prey.</p>
<hr />
<p>By spending 1 minute giving guidance to help hunt down your prey, you instruct up to five willing creatures to assist you. They gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Seek your prey, to Track your prey, and to Gather Information about your prey. You and the creatures assisting you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls when entering combat with your prey.</p>
<p>This benefit lasts until you designate a new prey or your prey dies, whichever comes first. An individual creature assisting&nbsp;you loses this benefit if they&rsquo;re out of your presence for too&nbsp;long to benefit from your instructions. This is usually 1 hour, but is determined by the GM.</p>
<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.OzvvsyjAWWij4mmm]{Keep Pace} Feat 6</h2>
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your prey is within reach and attempts to move away from you.</p>
<hr />
<p>Your prey can&rsquo;t Escape. Stride up to your Speed, following the foe and keeping it in reach throughout its movement until it stops moving or you&rsquo;ve moved your full Speed. You can use Keep Pace to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim instead of Stride if you have the corresponding movement type.</p>
<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.BVHDkBa4JMmmj5Sn]{Opportunistic Grapple} Feat 8</h2>
<p><strong>Requirements&nbsp;</strong>Your prey is within your reach, you have at least one free hand, and your target is no more than one size larger than you.</p>
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your prey critically fails on a melee Strike&rsquo;s attack roll against you.</p>
<hr />
<p>You attempt an Athletics check to Grapple your prey.</p>
