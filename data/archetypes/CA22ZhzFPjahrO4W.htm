<h1>Medic</h1>
<p>You&rsquo;ve studied countless techniques for providing medical aid, making you a peerless doctor and healer.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.MJg24e9fJd7OASvF]{Medic Dedication} Feat 2</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>&nbsp;trained in Medicine, Battle Medicine</p>
<hr />
<p>You become an expert in Medicine. When you succeed with Battle Medicine or Treat Wounds, the target regains 5 additional HP at DC 20, 10 HP at DC 30, or 15 HP at DC 40. Once per day, you can use Battle Medicine on a creature that&rsquo;s temporarily immune. If you&rsquo;re a master in Medicine, you can do so once per hour.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can&rsquo;t select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Medic archetype.</p>
<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.1fBHZpM3Z3MQtzvi]{Doctor&rsquo;s Visitation} Feat 4</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>&nbsp;Medic Dedication</p>
<hr />
<p>You move to provide immediate care to those who need it. Stride, then use one of the following: Battle Medicine or Treat Poison. You can spend a second action to instead Stride and then Administer First Aid or Treat a Condition (if you have it; see below).</p>
<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.rfnEcjxIFqwlJwJT]{Treat Condition} Feat 4</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisites&nbsp;</strong>Medic Dedication</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are holding healer&rsquo;s tools, or you are wearing them and have a hand free.</p>
<hr />
<p>You treat an adjacent creature in an attempt to reduce the clumsy, enfeebled, or sickened condition. If a creature has multiple conditions from this list, choose one. Attempt a counteract check against the condition, using your Medicine modifier as your counteract modifier and the condition&rsquo;s source to determine the DC. You can&rsquo;t treat a condition that came from an artifact or effect above 20th level unless you have Legendary Medic; even if you do, the counteract DC increases by 10. Treating a Condition that is continually applied under certain circumstances (for instance, the enfeebled condition a good character gains from carrying an unholy weapon) has no effect as long as the circumstances continue.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Reduce the condition value by 2.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> Reduce the condition value by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Increase the condition value by 1.</p>
<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.1WfvvjjObPKeZyid]{Holistic Care} Feat 6</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisites&nbsp;</strong>trained in Diplomacy, Treat Condition</p>
<hr />
<p>You provide emotional and spiritual care. Add frightened, stupefied, and stunned to the list of conditions you can reduce with Treat Condition. If the stunned condition has a duration instead of a value, you can&rsquo;t use Treat Condition to reduce it.</p>
<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.lleedxE6fTDSK6og]{Resuscitate} Feat 16</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisites&nbsp;</strong>Medic Dedication, legendary in Medicine</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are holding healer&rsquo;s tools or are wearing them and have a hand free. Also, the target&rsquo;s body is mostly intact.</p>
<hr />
<p>You can use Medicine to resuscitate the dead. Attempt a DC 40 Medicine check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of raise dead, except it still has the wounded condition it had before dying, increased by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn&rsquo;t wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Resuscitate for 1 day.</p>
