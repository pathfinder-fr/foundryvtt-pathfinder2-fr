<h1>Elementalist (Class Archetype)</h1>
<hr />
<p>You revere the four elements—air, earth, fire, and water—as the building blocks of creation and the source of all life. You believe that by balancing, mixing, and rearranging these four elements, magic is made. This belief has led you to eschew traditional magical theories and divisions, and you instead focus on harnessing, manipulating, and shaping the four elements. You cast spells drawn from multiple traditions and can use the four elements to alter and empower your spells, making them manifest and mixing them in unique ways. Most elementalists embrace the four elements equally as a mystical quaternity, and they strengthen their connection to one of these elements each day to protect themselves from harm. Others, notably sorcerer and wizard elementalists, feel a stronger connection to a singular element that they hone to great heights, utilizing the other three elements to support and augment their favored element.</p>

<hr />
<p>Each day when you make your daily preparations, you can attune yourself to one element of your choice: air, earth, fire, or water.</p>
<p>You gain resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1 resistance) against damage dealt by effects with your attuned elemental trait.</p>
<p>This attunement lasts until you next make your daily preparations.</p>

<hr />
<p>You enhance your spell with elemental water, soaking the target.</p>
<p>If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell targeting a single creature, you soak the target of the spell with water. If the target has @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Acid or Fire Damage}, the DC to end those conditions is reduced to 10, and the creature can attempt a flat check to end those types of persistent damage immediately.</p>

<hr />
<p>Your familiar becomes an elemental spirit capable of taking on aspects of the four elements: air, earth, fire, or water. Other than taking the form of an elemental instead of an animal, this familiar continues to use all the same rules as other familiars.</p>
<p>Your familiar gains one additional familiar ability each day, which must be one of the following elemental familiar abilities. While your familiar has an elemental familiar ability, your familiar is composed of the associated elemental matter and gains the matching elemental trait. You can't select more than one elemental familiar ability at a time.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Air</strong> If your familiar stays completely still for 1 round, it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible} until it next takes an action. Any motion, even being moved or carried by another creature, ends this effect.</li>
<li><strong>Earth</strong> Your familiar gains resistance to physical damage (except adamantine) equal to half your level.</li>
