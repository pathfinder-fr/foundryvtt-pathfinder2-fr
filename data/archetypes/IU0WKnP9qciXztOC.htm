<h1>Gladiator</h1>
<p>The roar of the crowd and thrill of competitive combat drive you to become the best&mdash;and the fame isn&rsquo;t bad either. If there are sapient creatures observing a combat encounter, and these onlookers are neither engaged in the combat themselves nor allied or affiliated with either side, the combatants have spectators. The GM is the final arbiter.</p>
