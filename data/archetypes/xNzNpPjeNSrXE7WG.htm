<h1>Crystal Keeper</h1>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">In the era before Earthfall, the elven people of Golarion exhibited a wide range of mastery over magic. A sect of elves who venerated the goddess Yuelral first developed the techniques of the crystal keeper, but this tradition has since been long forgotten by most of the world. There are those who still remember, though&mdash;PCs can gain access to the crystal keeper archetype from the tragic figure that haunts Jewelgate waystation in &ldquo;Fires of the Haunted City.&rdquo;</span></p>

<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.NrZt98r47sPSQ06j]{Crystal Ward Spells} Feat 4</h2>
<p>Prerequisites Crystal Keeper Dedication</p>
<hr />
<p>Your study of crystals and the energies held within a gem&rsquo;s facets grants you special arcane crystal ward spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool when you make your next daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to research and memorize the properties of gems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.57ulIxg3Of2wCbEh]{Electrified Crystal Ward} focus spell, and you are trained in arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs. Your spellcasting ability is Intelligence.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Crystal Keeper Dedication</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as you meditate before a gemstone worth at least 10 gp as part of your daily preparations, you are capable of seeing magic as flowing runes that reveal information about magic objects, and you can scribe a personal rune that represents you. You gain the read aura and sigil cantrips. You cast these cantrips as arcane innate spells at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.</p>
<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.81xlcIFJIAtsmXmd]{Armor Rune Shifter} Feat 10</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Crystal Keeper Dedication</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You learn the secrets of armor runes by viewing them through gems and can alter them at your discretion. Once per day when you make your daily preparations, you can focus on a rune&rsquo;s magical energies through a crystal&rsquo;s facets to alter a single property rune on one suit of armor in your possession to suppress its normal effects and make it function as a different property rune. You can temporarily alter the rune to function as one of the following runes: energy-resistant, fortification, glamered, invisibility, shadow, or slick. The property rune remains altered until you make your next daily preparations. The armor must meet the prerequisites for the temporary rune, and any other runes that required the suppressed rune are also suppressed while the rune is transformed. The rune is obviously altered, and thus the armor can&rsquo;t be sold as though it had the temporary rune.</p>
<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.5nzeyuvzKL4T8eLt]{Weapon-Rune Shifter} Feat 10</h2>
<p>Prerequisites Crystal Keeper Dedication</p>

Once per day during your daily preparations, you can focus on a rune&rsquo;s magical energies through a crystal&rsquo;s facets to alter a single property rune on one weapon in your possession to suppress its normal effects and make it function as a different property rune. You can temporarily alter the rune to function as one of the following runes: corrosive, flaming, frost, ghost touch, grievous, returning, shock, thundering, or wounding. The property rune remains altered until you make your next daily preparations. The weapon must meet the prerequisites for the temporary rune, and any other runes that required the suppressed rune are also suppressed while the rune is transformed. The rune is obviously altered, and thus the weapon can&rsquo;t be sold as though it had the temporary rune.</p>
