<h1>Scroll Trickster</h1>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.uxHWqFbYD0ZvkeF8]{Scroll Trickster Dedication} Feat 2</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion</p>
<hr />
<p>You've studied scrolls in depth. This might have been a comprehensive education in formal setting, or the sort of education where you somehow obtain a number of scrolls and try not to explode anything you didn't mean to explode. You gain the Trick Magic Item feat (Core Rulebook 268), and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks to Trick scrolls. If you roll a critical failure to Trick a Magic Item that's a scroll, you get a failure instead.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Scroll Trickster archetype.</p>
<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ROAUR1GhC19Pjk9C]{Basic Scroll Cache} Feat 6</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Scroll Trickster Dedication</p>
<hr />
<p>You have a vast and overflowing collection of scroll scraps, riddled with errors and misspellings and leaking energy like a sieve. With enough care, you can coax these scroll scraps into functioning-briefly. Each day during your daily preparations, you can create a single temporary scroll containing a 1st-level spell. The spell must be a common spell from the Core Rulebook, or another spell you learned via Learn a Spell, and it must come from a tradition in which you have the corresponding skill trained. This scroll is an unstable, temporary item and loses its magic the next time you make your daily preparations if you haven't already used it. It can't be used to Learn the Spell.</p>
<p>At 8th level, add a second temporary scroll containing a 2nd-level spell.</p>
