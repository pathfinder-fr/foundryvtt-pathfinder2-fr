<h1>Archer</h1>
<p>Bows of all types are powerful weapons. Generals and hunters alike recognize the power in dealing death from long distances, and from behind cover. Those dedicated to the bow&mdash;from mysterious cloaked strangers to heartless snipers&mdash;are often viewed with a mixture of respect and fear. Like any weapon adept, the archer&rsquo;s skill is forged through experience and constant practice. A true archer becomes one with the bow and is able to accomplish with that weapon things that most would consider impossible, or at least nearly magical.</p>
