<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Your toes are adapted for gripping and climbing. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.09PurtIanNUPfNRq]{Combat Climber} feat as a bonus feat, and as long as you aren’t wearing footwear, you can use the sticky pads on your feet to climb, leaving your hands free. Additionally, if you roll a success on an Athletics check to climb, you get a critical success instead.&nbsp;</span></p>
