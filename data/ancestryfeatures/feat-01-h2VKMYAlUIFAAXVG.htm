<p>You have batlike features, an affinity for batkind, and hearing that is second to none. As long as you can hear normally, you can use the Seek action to sense @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected} creatures in a 60-foot cone instead of a 30-foot cone. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to locate undetected creatures that you could hear within 30 feet with a Seek action.</p>
