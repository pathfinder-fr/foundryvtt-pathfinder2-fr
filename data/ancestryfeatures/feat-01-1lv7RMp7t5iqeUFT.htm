------ Description (en) ------
<p>You come from a long line of skilled hunters and trackers and have a particularly keen sense of smell. You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine a creature's location, as explained on page 456 of the Core Rulebook. The GM will usually double the range if you're downwind from the creature or halve the range if you're upwind.</p>
<p>In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.EA5vuSgJfiHH7plD]{Track} a creature or object if you've smelled it before.</p>
