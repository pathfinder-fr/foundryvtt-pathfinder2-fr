<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Some other source of magic has a greater hold on you than the primal magic of your fey lineage does. This connection might come from an occult plane or an ancient occult song; a deity, celestial, or fiend; magical effluent left behind by a mage war; or ancient rune magic.<br></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Choose <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?Tradition=1">arcane</a>, <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?Tradition=2">divine</a>, or <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?Tradition=3">occult</a>. You gain one cantrip from that magical tradition’s spell list. You can cast this spell as an innate spell at will, as a spell of your chosen tradition. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. Whenever you gain a primal innate spell from a gnome ancestry feat, change its tradition from primal to your chosen tradition.&nbsp;</span></p>
