------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your physiological needs are different than those of living creatures. You don't need to eat or drink. You don't need to sleep, but you still need a daily period of rest. During this period of rest, you must enter a recuperating standby state for 2 hours, which is similar to sleeping except you are aware of your surroundings and don't take penalties for being @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}. Much like with sleeping, if you go too long without entering your standby state, you become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.HL2l2VRSaQHu9lUw]{Fatigued} and can't recover until you enter standby for 2 hours.</p>
