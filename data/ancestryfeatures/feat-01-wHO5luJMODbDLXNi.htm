------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your body proves that shadow can’t exist without light. Perhaps your eyes glow brighter or your veins occasionally pulse with light. You emit dim light within 5 feet of you. You can activate or suppress this ability as an action, which has the concentrate trait. Additionally, you can force fragments of your shadow to glow and cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.kl2q6JvBZwed4B6v]{Dancing Lights} and @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.WBmvzNDfpwka3qT4]{Light} as occult innate cantrips. Cantrips are heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.</p>
