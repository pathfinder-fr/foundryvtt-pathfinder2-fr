<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You see all colors as brighter, hear all sounds as richer, and especially smell all scents with incredible detail. You gain a special sense: <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=412">imprecise</a> scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine the exact location of a creature. The GM will usually double the range if you’re downwind from the creature or halve the range if you’re upwind.<br></span></p>
