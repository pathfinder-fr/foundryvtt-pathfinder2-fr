<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Your ancestors were famous trackers, and you carry in your blood that same gift of the hunt. You gain a special sense: imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine the location of a creature, but it remains @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden}. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.EA5vuSgJfiHH7plD]{Track} creatures that you have previously sensed with your scent.</span></p>
