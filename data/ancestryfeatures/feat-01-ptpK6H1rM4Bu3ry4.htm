<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-11f12efa-7fff-e078-516e-02b4416b3602">You come from a line of tengu ascetics, leaving you with a link to the spirits of the world and the Great Beyond. You can cast the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.kcelf6IHl3L9VXXg]{Disrupt Undead} cantrip as a primal innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. </span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-11f12efa-7fff-e078-516e-02b4416b3602">Each time you cast a spell from a tengu heritage or ancestry feat, you can decide whether it's a divine or primal spell.</span></p>
