<p>Your mother was a hag. Your heterochromatic eyes are the most obvious signifier of this parentage, but you likely also have a slighter build, paler skin, and darker hair than most members of your other parent’s ancestry. You gain the changeling trait. You also gain @Compendium[pf2e.ancestryfeatures.DRtaqOHXTRtGRIUT]{Low-Light Vision}, or you gain @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.yblD8fOR1J8rDwEQ]{Confused} if your ancestry already has low-light vision. You can select from changeling feats and feats from your other parent’s ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.</p>
