------ Description (en) ------
Perpetually cursed to hunger and failure, a culdewen plies waterways in search of appealing fish to catch-the bigger the better. Of course, this diminutive, emaciated fey calls every living creature a &quot;fish.&quot; Only other fey are exempt, and they tend to consider culdewens lost causes. A culdewen can never find satisfaction. Each time they catch a fish, a magical curse forces them to hunt for an appealing spot to dine-an island, cove, or abandoned dock or shack where they can eat in peace. By the time they arrive, their catch will be gone. Every time. Forever.<br><br>A foul mood hovers over a culdewen, causing them to swear colorfully, smack things with their oar, and shake their tiny fists at the sky. Conversation with a culdewen is fruitless, as they talk in circles, speaking only of fishing and the weather. Capturing a &quot;fish&quot; gives a culdewen a rare moment of happiness; the culdewen capers and ululates, pleased with their catch, and rushes off to their boat.<br><br>
