------ Description (en) ------
Ifrits' blood blazes with elemental fire. Most ifrits are second-class citizens who serve under the iron heel of the efreeti and their Dominion of Flame, but those born outside the efreet hierarchy or who choose to flee it live lives of passion in search of fame, glory, and power.<br><br> Ifrits are fond of fire, but this doesn't mean they all embrace fire's destructive nature. Those who seek more productive roles in a society find inspiration in the way flames flit and dance, and they pride themselves in their skills as acrobats or dancers. The church of Sarenrae particularly welcomes ifrit fire dancers, both in appreciation of their skill and to help ensure these ifrits have a safe place apart from their more violent kin.<br><br> But by and large, ifrits are drawn to professions and callings that allow them to wallow in the glories of fire. Ifrit pyrochemists apply this calling to alchemical teachings, seeing purity in every single bomb thrown or conflagration lit.<br><br>
