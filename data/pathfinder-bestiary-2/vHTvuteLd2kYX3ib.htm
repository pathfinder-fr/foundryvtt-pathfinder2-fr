------ Description (en) ------
While often seen as unfriendly by non-leshys, flytrap leshys get along well with other leshys. Nonetheless, they're among the most aggressive leshys, often guarding the most vulnerable places in the natural world with their flytrap mouths and hands.<br><br> When a large threat emerges, pairs of flytrap leshys band together to create amalgams capable of driving back powerful foes. This unusual form of communal defense suffuses flytrap leshy society, and they often form relationships between multiple individuals that would confuse or even scandalize more uptight humanoids-to a flytrap leshy, though, there's nothing strange about sharing your innermost secrets with people you literally merged together with to defend your home from an enemy.<br><br>
