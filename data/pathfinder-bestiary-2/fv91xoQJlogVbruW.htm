Name: Aapoph Serpentfolk
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
Aapophs possess greater strength and stronger venom than their zyss kin, but they lack zyss' intelligence and innate magic. Unlike their selfish superiors, aapophs are communal and group together to hunt, wrestle, and sleep curled together in pits. Though they're looked down upon and insulted by zyss, most aapophs lack the higher brain functions to recognize when they're being insulted, much less plan or execute a rebellion. Aapophs often have unusual physical mutations-horns, vestigial tails, or spines protruding from their scales-yet these variations have little impact on their overall combat prowess- and combat prowess is the measure by which zyss judge them.<br /><br />
