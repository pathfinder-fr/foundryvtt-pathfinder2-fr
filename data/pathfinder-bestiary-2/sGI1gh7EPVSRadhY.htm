------ Description (en) ------
This squat and stony creature looks like an armadillo with a large raised back and a flail-like tail. The granite glyptodont has no true need to feed, as with all elementals, yet it does seem to linger after transforming the flesh of those it calcifies, as if the mere proximity of flesh fossilizing into stone pleases it somehow.<br /><br />
