------ Description (en) ------
Aolazes are great beasts carved from stone and metal and magically imbued with the essence of life. The exact means of their creation is a long-lost secret, and they are so rare that scholars have little opportunity to study active specimens. The best-known aolazes are museum pieces or battlefield relics destroyed or deactivated centuries ago, though fragmented records suggest that many more were made and might remain, yet to be unearthed.<br><br>Most aolazes are built in the shape of great land-bound beasts, such as elephants, rhinoceroses, or dinosaurs. Regardless of the specific creature an aolaz has been constructed to resemble, it is not bound to walk the earth like its inspirations are—it's imbued with the magical ability to pursue across water and even through the air. Few can escape an aolaz's wrath once it is earned.<br><br>
