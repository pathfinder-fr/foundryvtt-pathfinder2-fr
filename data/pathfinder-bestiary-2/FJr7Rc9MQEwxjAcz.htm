------ Description (en) ------
Urdefhan spellcasters with a knack for the divine are invariably unholy worshippers of daemonkind, typically taking on one of Abaddon's Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as their patron deity. With their unholy gifts, these urdefhan tormentors summon daemons into battle and bolster their allies with profane magic, preferring to stick to the sidelines rather than enter the fray directly.<br /><br />
