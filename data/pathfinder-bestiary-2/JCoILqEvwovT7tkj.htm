------ Description (en) ------
These notorious predators have an undeniable thirst for blood. Chupacabras prefer to prey upon the weak and slow, often hiding in wait and watching potential prey for long periods before attacking. Spry and stealthy, they most often make their homes in areas of high grass and protective rock, their slightly reflective scales allowing them to blend in well with such surroundings.<br /><br />Chupacabras prefer to eat lone travelers and farm animals (particularly goats), and leave little evidence of their presence apart from the grisly, blood-drained husks of their meals. Their tendency to stay out of sight combined with their naturally nocturnal activity often leads superstitious locals to conclude the worst, imagining that a particularly reckless vampire lives in the area.<br /><br />A typical chupacabra measures nearly 5-1/2 feet from its muzzle to the tip of its spiny tail, and it stands just under 4 feet tall. With their slight build and lightweight bones, most weigh close to 100 pounds. They mate rarely and only during the hottest months, with the females each producing a single egg that hatches into a tiny, dehydrated creature. The mother typically leaves helpless prey in her cave so the hatchling can immediately feed.<br /><br />Although chupacabras are typically solitary creatures, they have been known to form small gangs in bountiful areas. Members of these groups work well together, growing bold enough to attack larger animals, small herds, and otherwise more dangerous prey. Stories of chupacabras attacking travelers or laying siege to farmhouses typically stem from the hunting practices of such gangs. Regions where chupacabra activity like this is more common often have complex and colorful myths and tall tales about chupacabra capabilities or motive -- and a few of the claims, such as that some chupacabras can fly, are all too true.<br /><br />
