Name: Nyogoth
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
Little more than a coiled mass of intestines encircling a massive gaping maw, this qlippoth is an Abyssal scavenger, subsisting on the filth and leftovers of demons and qlippoth alike, although it relishes any opportunity to consume living prey. Despite this seeming lowly role in the Abyssal ecosystem, a nyogoth is far from a stupid beast and can orchestrate cunning ambushes to secure its next meal.<br /><br />
