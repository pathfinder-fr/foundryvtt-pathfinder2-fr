------ Description (en) ------
This reaver of the cold marsh is not just a monster; he is a force of nature. Where there is peace and prosperity in the world, Grendel strikes, eager to prove that tranquility is transitory and death is the only constant. He stalks the edge of his fens, seeking settlements where joy holds sway. He strikes under cover of night, primarily targeting celebrations or festivals. The more happiness or joy he can extinguish, the better.<br /><br /> Although Grendel is a unique creature, killing him won't save the world from his ravages for long. Once Grendel's mother instinctively feels the pain of her violent son's death, she soon births a replacement. The new Grendel seems to avoid the sites his elder brothers terrorized, as if he instinctively knows that such a place hosts heroes powerful enough to defeat him.<br /><br />
