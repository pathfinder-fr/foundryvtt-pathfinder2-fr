------ Description (en) ------
The aberrations known as doprillus are hulks with banded muscles who wear ornate masks at all times that fill their wearers with magical strength and fighting spirit. Doprillus love to battle, especially by grappling, and are eager to start brawls. On neutral ground, a doprillu offers to duel the strongest-looking opponent, but when a doprillu's home turf is invaded, no rules apply to the confrontation. As befits the superheated blood that fuels them, doprillus make their homes in warm locations: hot jungles, sunny deserts, and underground caverns near sulfur vents.<br /><br />
