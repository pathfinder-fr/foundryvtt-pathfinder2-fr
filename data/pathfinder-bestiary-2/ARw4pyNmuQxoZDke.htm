------ Description (en) ------
These brash and arrogant creatures are among the more energetic mephits. They are quick to nominate themselves the leaders of any group, barking out orders in shrill, high-pitched voices and insisting on having everything done their way. Even when they aren't bossing others around, the constant hiss of steam escaping from their pores ensures that there is never a quiet moment.<br /><br />
