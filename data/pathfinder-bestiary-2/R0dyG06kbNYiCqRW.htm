Name: Water Yai
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
Among the most powerful yai are those who emulate the form of storm giants. Rather than lord over their giant-kin like most oni, though, water yai prefer to lurk alone in the world's oceans (or, much more rarely, large and remote fresh-water lakes). When a water yai must interact with mortals beneath the waves, they prefer to do so while disguised as a storm giant. Water yai pursue the acquisition of material wealth and riches above all other interests, garbing themselves in richly colored, magically waterproofed kimonos and adorning their monstrous faces with all manner of jewelry. These yai can infuse their kimonos with eerie magical properties, and in combat, they can also fire bolts of electricity from their third eye.<br><br>
