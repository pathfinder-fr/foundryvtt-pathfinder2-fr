Name: Witchfire

------ Description (en) ------
Manifesting as a sinuous form wreathed in sickly green flames, this incorporeal undead forms when a powerful hag or witch dies in agony or rage. The body at the center of the flames usually resembles the witch's idealized self-image, regardless of their age and appearance at the time of their death.<br /><br /> A witchfire often resides in a bog or swamp, which slowly blackens and decays around them. These regions are often plagued by will-o'-wisps, which seem to have an uncanny relationship with the resident witchfire. A witchfire might visit villages on the edge of their home terrain to lure away villagers, but always attack victims within earshot to make sure that other villagers hear the screams. A witchfire might also ally with other hags or witches and even join their covens, but a witchfire is incapable of forming covens entirely on their own.<br /><br />
