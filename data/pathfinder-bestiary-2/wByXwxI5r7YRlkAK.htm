------ Description (en) ------
Shoggti travel to other planes in roving bands to capture and charm victims, bringing them back to the Abyss where they are enslaved for unknown—but no doubt insidiously evil—purposes. These squid-like qlippoth have slick, blue skin and four suckered tentacles that end in dexterous pincers. In addition to a lamprey-like mouth at the base of its body, each has a secondary maw in the middle of its forehead that stretches from between its two bulging eyes to the back of its head.<br><br>
