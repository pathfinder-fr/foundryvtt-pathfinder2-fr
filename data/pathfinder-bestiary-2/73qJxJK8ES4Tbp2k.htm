Name: Lurker In Light
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
These malicious and strange fey appear as fairies about 2 feet tall, with insectile wings, large eyes, and bulbous heads. They slaughter and cause mischief in a pattern only their alien intellect understands, but they've been seen to take particular umbrage against dwarves, gnomes, and creatures who live in darkness. With their grudges and pursuit of their own wicked and sadistic whims, lurkers in light deftly overturn the conventional wisdom that creatures associated with light are benign and friendly.<br /><br /> While lurkers in light are fey and have ties to the First World, these creatures are often found elsewhere in the Great Beyond. They are particularly fond of invading the Shadow Plane to bring light to those who dwell there-not to help, but to spread misery and pain among those to whom light is agonizing.<br /><br />
