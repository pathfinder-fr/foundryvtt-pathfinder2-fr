------ Description (en) ------
Although they spend most of their time hunting and battling demons for control of the Abyss, thulgants amuse themselves with a variety of diversions, such as maintaining galleries of petrified mortals or building massive, hive-like lairs filled with enslaved minions. Each of these qlippoth is a horrific tangle of limbs, with spiderlike legs, writhing tentacles emerging from the top of its head, and three scorpion-like stingers.<br /><br />
