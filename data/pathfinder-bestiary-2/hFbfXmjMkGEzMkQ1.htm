------ Description (en) ------
These omnivorous birds are cunning and opportunistic scavengers. Capable of solving simple puzzles in order to retrieve desired items, ravens gather at the periphery of civilization, raiding it as needed when they are not hunting in the wilds. Whether singularly, in pairs, or as a flock, ravens live off scraps as often as they do carrion or prey. They are also unusually social among their own kind, even alerting other ravens to large carcasses with loud, croaking cries; it is rumored that this extends between flocks as well.<br><br>
