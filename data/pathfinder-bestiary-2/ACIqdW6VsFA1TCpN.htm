------ Description (en) ------
While manta rays might appear daunting, they are generally docile. Manta rays are found in temperate or tropical oceans, and they generally stay in the upper reaches or at the surface of deeper waters. These rays are filter feeders that subsist on plankton. They can also eat larger fish or aquatic creatures as the need arises, but rarely attack anything Small or larger. Many underwater cultures, particularly aquatic elves, raise and farm manta rays to serve as messengers, beasts of burden, or even pets. Manta rays don't make particularly good mounts, but some aquatic civilizations use them to draw underwater carriages.<br><br>
