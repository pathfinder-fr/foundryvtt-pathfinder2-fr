------ Description (en) ------
Two-headed trolls are savage, dual-minded monsters with an unquenchable thirst for bloodshed, and dread tales of their ravenous appetites are whispered of in homesteads throughout the lands of the Inner Sea. Indeed, it is a custom for parents to invoke the two-headed troll as a warning to misbehaving children. &quot;Finish your chores,&quot; a parent might say to a stubborn child, &quot;or a two-headed troll will snatch you away at night and swallow you whole!&quot; It's unclear why such a morbid tradition gained traction with parents, but it's an undeniable fact that two-headed trolls have an appetite for &quot;nibbles&quot;-creatures small enough to devour with one bite.<br /><br /> Mature two-headed trolls stand 13 feet in height, weighing roughly 1,700 pounds. Unlike common trolls, two-headed trolls share the upright gait of their ettin ancestry and do not walk hunched over.
