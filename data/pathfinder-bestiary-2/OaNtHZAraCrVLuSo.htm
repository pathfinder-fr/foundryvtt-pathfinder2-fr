------ Description (en) ------
<p>The weight of murder wears heavy on the soul. With souls marked by a lifetime of dealing death, these killers, whether mass murderers, bloodthirsty soldiers, or sadistic executioners, sometimes do not let judgment and lawful execution stanch their slaying sprees. When such individuals are brought to justice, they may rise after death as mohrgs to continue their ruinous work.</p>
<p>Drawn to others of their kind, mohrgs prefer to hunt in small groups, occasionally in partnership with weaker free-willed undead such as shadows and wights. They seek out weak prey and revel in causing drawn-out suffering. Some mohrgs haunt locations they favored in life, reenacting old crimes on new victims. They may even skulk about in public, wearing rags, cloaks, or freshly harvested skins to hide their nature. The most dangerous mohrgs are those who grow powerful enough to no longer fear being struck down again and openly assault settlements in an attempt to turn living towns into mass graves.</p>
<p>Since those slain by a mohrg rise soon thereafter as mohrg spawn, the murders of a mohrg rarely go unnoticed for long, even when they take extra care to prey only on a society's dregs. Since mohrg spawn remain under a mohrg's control, a canny mohrg might order its spawn to remain in hiding to keep its presence secret until a point where it feels confident unleashing its undead army upon a doomed settlement.</p>
<p>Mohrgs retain a twisted sentimentality for the crimes of their mortal life, seeking out trinkets that remind them of favorite murders. When not out hunting, mohrgs arrange their mementos into disturbing shrines. Often, these&nbsp; trinkets are valuable objects, and might even provide important clues to ongoing mysteries.</p>
