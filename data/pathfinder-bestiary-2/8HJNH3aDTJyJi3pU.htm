Name: Cockroach Swarm

------ Description (en) ------
While cockroaches tend to gather in cramped spaces, a disturbed colony is sometimes prone to swarming, where hundreds or even thousands of the insects scurry out of their hiding places in a raft of shiny brown and black carapaces on thousands of skittering legs. Given how disgusting many find cockroaches to be, encountering such a swarm can be alarming to even the most seasoned adventurers. The creatures are relentless when disturbed; in contrast to the insects' normally skittish and harmless nature, as swarms they pursue the creature or creatures that provoked them and harry them with thousands of stinging bites.<br><br>
