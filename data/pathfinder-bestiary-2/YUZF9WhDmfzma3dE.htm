------ Description (en) ------
Nalfeshnees are huge, corpulent, boar-headed demons that hoard treasures and knowledge alike and form from the souls of avaricious mortals. Few demons understand the inner workings of the Abyss itself like nalfeshnees, and it's not unusual for a nalfeshnee to see itself as a servitor of the Abyss itself first rather than bow before a demon lord. Some claim stewardship over the fleshy realms that birth new demons, while others guard sites of particular significance deep in the plane's secret reaches. A nalfeshnee's realm in the Abyss can easily surpass the strength and size of the largest mortal kingdoms, for nalfeshnees display a singular gift for managing and manipulating the chaos of the Abyss.<br /><br />
