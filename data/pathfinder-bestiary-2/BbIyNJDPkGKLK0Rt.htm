Name: Vexgit
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
These gremlins are covered head-to-toe by a crustacean-like exoskeleton that clacks and rattles whenever a vexgit moves. They delight in sabotaging the works of other creatures, often turning these works into dangerous traps. An individual vexgit might jam a door lock, loosen the wheels on a carriage, or remove nails from a boat hull. Buildings infested by vexgits become filled with traps like portcullises descending suddenly, water pipes exploding violently, and clock towers disgorging an avalanches of gears.<br> Aware of their own physical weakness, vexgits carry hammers and other tools to leverage pieces apart or smash whatever they're unable to disassemble. Indeed, a hammer sized for a human becomes a maul in the tiny hands of a vexgit.<br> Vexgit infestations range from one to a score. Larger groups are often led by a more powerful vexgit with additional skill in thievery or primal magic. Trained giant rats, vipers, and rat swarms are common in vexgit lairs.<br><br>
