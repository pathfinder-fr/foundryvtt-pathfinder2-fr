------ Description (en) ------
Ice yai combine the brutality of frost giants with the grace of martial artists. More than any other oni, ice yai delight not in the pleasures of the flesh, but in flesh itself—rather than indulging in oft-destructive mortal vices like drink or lust, ice yai pursue physical perfection, reveling in the process of turning their bodies into powerful fighting machines.<br><br>
