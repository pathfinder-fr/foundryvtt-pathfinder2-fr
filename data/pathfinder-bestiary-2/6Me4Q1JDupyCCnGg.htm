Name: Ice Mephit
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
Though capable of the same depths of cruelty as their fire mephit kin, ice mephits carry theirs out in a more calculating way. Unlike most mephits, these pale blue mephits prefer solitude to company. Lacking in empathy, they are known for their callousness, and have a reputation for brutal honesty. They also have few moral qualms about acting selfishly and exploiting weakness for their own gain, should the chance arise.<br><br>
