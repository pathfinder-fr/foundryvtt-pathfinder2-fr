------ Description (en) ------
The beings of righteous fury known as planetars are known to be the least patient of angels. They exist to destroy evil that cannot be redeemed, and they often leave prolonged dialogue to other angels. Of course, no planetar ignores the importance of diplomacy, but they know that others among the angelic hosts are better suited to that task, while they focus on the larger picture. In angelic armies, planetars serve as commanders or generals. They stand at least 9 feet tall and weigh over 500 pounds.<br /><br />
