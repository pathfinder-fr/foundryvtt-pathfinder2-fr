------ Description (en) ------
Even daemons fear the most massive and terrifying of their kind, olethrodaemons. No single entity could embody the level of evil necessary to manifest one; instead, these living war machines are made from the souls of many-or so the story goes. Other theories suggest that the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are responsible for creating the olethrodaemons, or that olethrodaemons are merely the seeping run-off of an even greater being: a mysterious fifth Horseman.<br><br>Whatever the truth, olethrodaemons are real, and their existence is terrifying enough to instill paralyzing existential dread. With dozens of unblinking glowing eyes above a drooling maw, two sets of four muscled limbs, and countless horns, olethrodaemons resemble no other creature known to mortalkind.<br><br>
