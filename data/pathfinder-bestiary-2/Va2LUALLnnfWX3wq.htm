Name: Vrolikai
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
Unlike other demons, the dread vrolikai doesn't form from a sinful soul-they instead manifest from a nabasu once the nabasu finally satisfies their hunger and returns to the Abyss, and as such vrolikais suffer from no vulnerability associated with a specific sin. A vrolikai who survives this process and the period of vulnerability that follows gains great power and in time can claim large regions of the Abyss as their own domain. Also known as death demons, these murderous monsters often serve demon lords as executioners or assassins.<br><br>
