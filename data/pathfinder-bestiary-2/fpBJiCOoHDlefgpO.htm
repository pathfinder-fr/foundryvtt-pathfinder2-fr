------ Description (en) ------
Thunderbirds bring storms on their wings. In times of drought, they are welcomed. Other times, they are offered gifts in hopes they might leave before flooding begins. When angered, they call down hurricanes and lay waste to entire villages, so many settlements conduct extensive rites to appease and honor local thunderbirds.<br /><br /> Thunderbird parents carry their newly hatched offspring to hidden mountaintop nests, where the young are struck by their first bolts of lightning and learn the mysteries of the storm.<br /><br />
