------ Description (en) ------
Calathgars are mysterious predatory plants that grow in the depths of the densest frozen forests, realms where icicles rarely melt from snow-cloaked trees. A calathgar's blue flowers grow from 3 to 5 feet across (with specimens as wide as 10 feet reported), while the plant itself stands just under 4 feet in height and weighs up to 50 pounds when heavy with seeds.<br><br>Calathgars' psyches are alien to most sapient creatures. They have little interest in emotion, culture, or ambition, yet they have nearly flawless memories and can share experiences with other calathgars by scent (imprecise) as easily as humanoids can pass on information by speech. While calathgars themselves can't speak, they can typically be reasoned with-though like most protective parents, an incensed calathgar defending its young is rarely in a mood to listen.<br><br>
