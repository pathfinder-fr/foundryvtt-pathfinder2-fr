------ Description (en) ------
Among the rank-and-file soldiers of Heaven's armies, few individuals are more dependable and truer to the cause than the noble hound archons, embodiments of the virtue of diligence. Unlike horned archons, who perform at a similar level along Heaven's grand hierarchy, hound archons do not scout ahead for evil or perform reconnaissance missions in hostile territory. A hound archon's role is as a soldier in the heart of battle or, occasionally, as a sentinel tasked with protecting a particular strategic location or holy site.<br><br>
