------ Description (en) ------
In transforming xulgaths, drow fleshwarpers sought not to create a new type of creature but to recapture a form of xulgath predecessor believed entirely vanished from Golarion. Ghonhatines are the result-hulking reptilian beasts who prefer to crawl on all fours and tear at their foes with bestial fury.<br /><br />
