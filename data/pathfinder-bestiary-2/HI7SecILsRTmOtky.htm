Name: Shocker Lizard
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
These brightly colored reptiles share the rough size and pack mentality of guard dogs, roaming in small groups. Shocker lizards have specialized glands under their scales that accumulate static electricity, and they can unleash blasts of lightning strong enough to harm significantly larger foes. Though they're meek and docile when encountered alone, shocker lizards are significantly more aggressive in packs, when they can amplify each other's electrical attacks.<br /><br /> Shocker lizards are notoriously difficult to domesticate because they're dangerously hostile as part of a pack, but will also swiftly wither and die if kept alone in captivity without constant attention. A shocker lizard is 3 feet long and weighs 25 pounds.<br /><br />
