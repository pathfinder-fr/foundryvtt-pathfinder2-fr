------ Description (en) ------
Dracolisks are rare magical crossbreeds of chromatic dragons and basilisks. None now know how they first came to be, but they have proven viable and can breed with one another as well as with basilisks. While a dracolisk appears much like a young true dragon of its parent type, its eight legs are an immediate indication that it is something more. Its coloration varies, depending on the nature of its draconic ancestry, though it's lighter on its underside and darker near its wing tips. A typical dracolisk is 15 feet long and weighs 3,000 pounds.<br /><br />
