------ Description (en) ------
Carnivorous blobs are the ravenous spawn of shattered worlds far beyond the stars, born across the galaxy in inert form until they fall like meteorites onto unsuspecting worlds. These massive beings can lie dormant for years in desolate caverns or barren wastelands. When a carnivorous blob perceives living creatures nearby, it lurches to gelatinous life, seeking out and consuming every creature it can catch until it is destroyed or until it has been unable to locate food for 24 hours, at which point it returns to hibernation. Often, keeping food away from a carnivorous blob is the safest way to defeat it. The blob's ability to split into smaller oozes that might stay hidden after a fight means it can be hard to fully eradicate these mindless predators.<br><br>
