------ Description (en) ------
These ferocious werecreatures stalk prey with the cunning and skill of a true apex predator. Weretigers typically view all life as a potential meal. Powerful nocturnal hunters with excellent senses that help them ambush prey, weretigers are adaptable to an extreme range of environments. However, weretigers living in densely populated cities  often struggle to suppress their killer instincts, becoming overwhelmed by the urge to hunt. They prefer to wear loose-fitting clothing and rely on their claws and jaws in a fight.<br><br>
