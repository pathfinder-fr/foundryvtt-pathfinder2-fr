------ Description (en) ------
Crabs are scavenging crustaceans known for their hard shells and iconic sideways gait. They use their claws to defend themselves, hunt, and fight other crabs for territory. When confronted with threats from outside their species, most crabs prefer to flee, but when retreat isn't possible, they clamp on to their foes as tightly as they can.<br><br>The statistics presented here represent giant crabs that live close to the water's surface. Crabs that live deeper underwater often exhibit more extreme adaptations to their environment. Crabs who live in the depths where little light reaches gain darkvision and cold resistance, and those adapted to the most hostile reaches of the deep sea can detect nearby creatures through subtle shifts in ocean currents.<br><br>These skittering creatures are prized for their delicious meat, but their size makes them dangerous targets for harvesting.<br><br>
