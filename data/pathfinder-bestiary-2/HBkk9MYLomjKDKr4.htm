------ Description (en) ------
Azuretzis are sinuous, serpentine creatures with dagger-sharp teeth, covered in brilliant blue scales with mottled purple and pink highlights that shimmer in a pareidolic approximation of leering, laughing faces. The Maelstrom's chaotic forces spawn these small proteans from a variety of sources: physical mating between older azuretzis, the paradoxical promotion of bestial naunets, and possibly from mortal petitioners, though azuretzis may just be confusing putative mortal memories with experiences gained from games of mimicry. Never expect azuretzis to operate by any rational, self-consistent rules.<br><br> Azuretzis represent the humor of chaos, particularly in the form of mockery and parody via exaggerated mimicry, twisting a target's features into a laughingstock.<br><br>
