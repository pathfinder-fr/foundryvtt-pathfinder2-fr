Name: Destrachan

------ Description (en) ------
This underground reptilian horror walks on two powerful hind legs. Its forelimbs are armed with sharp curving claws, and its toothy, eyeless, tubular head has three hypersensitive frilled ears that turn toward any sound made in its vicinity. This cruel monster's true weapon, however, is an amplified version of the sonic cry that it uses to navigate, communicate, and hunt. It communicates with others of its kind through a complex series of clicks, shrieks, and whistles, but it is intelligent enough to understand other languages. Most destrachans understand at least one other language-usually Undercommon-and can often be reasoned with.<br /><br />An obligate carnivore, the destrachan relishes fresh meat but won't hesitate to make a meal of carrion it finds in its path. When traveling in packs, the creatures take great delight in stalking travelers through miles of tunnels before attacking and subduing them, then devouring them alive.<br /><br />
