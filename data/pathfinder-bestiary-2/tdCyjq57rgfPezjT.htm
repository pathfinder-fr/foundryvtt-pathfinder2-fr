------ Description (en) ------
Never have legend and misinformation met upon a more inauspicious brow than that of the lowly carbuncle. At first glance, carbuncles appear to be little more than ungainly reptiles. What sets them apart is their strange magical abilities and the gemstone-like horn protruding from between their goggling eyes. Although rumors suggest various uses for carbuncle horns, ranging from miracle cure-alls to potent magical components, the truth is much more mundane: a carbuncle's horn is merely a highly reflective growth, not unlike a fingernail.<br><br>
