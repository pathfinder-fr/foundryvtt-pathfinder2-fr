------ Description (en) ------
Cave scorpions prefer to reside in underground lairs. Most have lost nearly all of their pigmentation, making them appear ghostly when they lurk at the edge of the light. While they prefer to eat large insects, cave scorpions can and will attack humanoids. Some Darklands societies have developed techniques to herd or lure scorpions into pest-infested tunnels and warrens at the edge of their settlements, where the scorpions thrive in a dual role of exterminators and guardians.<br /><br />
