------ Description (en) ------
<p>Also known as the deacons of death, thanadaemons represent death via old age. They are among the most patient daemons, and prefer to bide their time to enact far-reaching, decades-long plans rather than fight (though they are still deadly foes). Like the Horseman of Death, they ply the waters of the River Styx in search of wayward souls. Rarely are thanadaemons seen without a trademark oar (which they wield as a bo staff), a tool they use to navigate the river's muck-ridden channels and turbulent rapids.</p>
<hr />
<p>Daemons form from the most despicable souls and personify forms of death.</p>
