------ Description (en) ------
Esoboks are brute hunters and pugnacious sentinels that serve as the guard dogs of the Boneyard. These squat, powerful quadrupeds have a frill of dark feathers around their distinctive heads which resemble a crocodile skull. Esoboks rarely bother with those who are truly dead, allowing the dead of the Boneyard to go about their business while remaining watchful for danger. Though cunning when sniffing out threats to the Boneyard or to their psychopomp handlers, they're among the least intelligent of the psychopomps and rarely speak except to utter growling threats. The wise listen when an esobok makes a threat, as it won't do so twice.<br /><br />
