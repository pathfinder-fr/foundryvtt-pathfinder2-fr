------ Description (en) ------
Slavers and raiders from the cold, windswept dimension of Leng, these malevolent humanoids range across reality in ominous black ships capable of sailing beyond the borders of dimensions and planes. Although most denizens of Leng seek slaves and plunder like any pirate, others operate as self-styled ambassadors and merchants, sowing discord with far-ranging plots. While the inscrutable denizens dress themselves in flowing robes, veils, and broad turbans to appear human, their aberrant physiology, when glimpsed, is evident from their crown of stubby horns and tentacled jaws to their furry, goat-like legs.<br /><br />Above the fierce captains who command the infamous black ships are an even higher caste of denizens of Leng. These cultists and musicians serve as high priests, laboring to appease the frightening gods who look down upon the Nightmare Realm with cold malice.<br /><br />
