Name: Blodeuwedd
Nom:

------ Description (en) ------
The mysterious blodeuwedds dwell in those parts of the world where the boundaries between the Material Plane and the First World have worn thin, or around portals between the two planes. Their link with such regions of the natural world is so strong that it rivals the bond shared between nymphs and places of great natural beauty, yet none would look upon a blodeuwedd and mistake them for something as elegant as a nymph.<br><br>Although blodeuwedds share certain traits with nymphs, their role as guardians of the pathways between this world and the First World prevents them from forming as powerful a magical bond with the natural world. Never truly a part of either reality yet forced to keep watch over both, blodeuwedds tend to grow cynical and sharp-tongued toward any who would seek travel from one realm to the other, regardless of their actual goals.<br><br>
