------ Description (en) ------
The frost worm's single round, red eye gleams prominently at the head of its monstrous mass, white as a winter snowfall. What appears to be a bifurcated lower jaw is actually two spiky parapodia that the worm uses to shovel food into its lamprey-like mouth. An adult frost worm measures 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.<br /><br /> A frost worm is an apex predator that uses camouflage, burrowing, and deceit to ambush its prey. When it attacks, a frost worm produces a distinctive, high-pitched trill. Though some survivors of frost worm attacks have compared it to a wailing lament, the trill has a captivating effect on nearby creatures, causing them to stop and listen even as the monstrous creature approaches.<br /><br /> The cold shed by a frost worm is as dangerous as its trill or its jaws, and while it is not fond of warmer climates, neither is it particularly hampered in such regions. A frost worm that somehow finds itself in temperate or even tropical environs causes the immediate area to chill and ice over with frost over time, creating seemingly impossible pockets of frozen terrain.<br /><br />
