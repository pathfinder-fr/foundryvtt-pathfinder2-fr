------ Description (en) ------
The enigmatic and strange radiant wardens were constructed thousands of years ago to protect observatories and scholars against the incursion of alien aggressors from the Dominion of the Black. Over time, their roles as guardians expanded to include watching over any region where the laws of time and space have worn thin, particularly near portals and permanent gates between planets, planes, or dimensions.<br /><br /> Named for both the radial nature of the concentric rings that make up their bodies as well as the glowing radiance of their attacks, radiant wardens carry on their orders, defending sites from invasion with single-minded purpose.<br /><br />
