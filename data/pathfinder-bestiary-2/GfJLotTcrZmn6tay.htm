------ Description (en) ------
Few creatures embody war's sheer amount of bloodshed and loss of life as deeply as the purrodaemons, deacons of war. These giant humanoid daemons are bedecked in black, unholy armor, with weapons piercing their flesh at every opening. Far from wounds, however, these weapons are the purrodaemon's arsenal. A purrodaemon can, with frightening swiftness and nauseating ease, extract a weapon from its own flesh as though drawing a sword from a sheath, and their blood is so tainted with evil that weapons steeped in it become powerful tools of war.<br /><br />
