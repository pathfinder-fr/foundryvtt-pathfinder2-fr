------ Description (en) ------
An immense, gnarled, tree awoken with raw, primal power by one of the fey Eldest of the First World, this monster-one of the legendary Tane-skitters on huge, spidery roots and thrashes its branches as fiery lightning courses within its blackened bark, a living manifestation of the violent clash between ancient forest and stormy sky.<br><br>
