------ Description (en) ------
<p>You're adapted to life in the forest or the deep jungle, and you know how to climb trees and use foliage to your advantage. When @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climbing} trees, vines, and other foliage, you move at half your Speed on a success and at full Speed on a critical success (and you move at full Speed on a success if you have @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.P04Hw8E6WAWARKHP]{Quick Climb}). This doesn't affect you if you're using a climb Speed.</p>
<p>You can always use the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.ust1jJSCZQUhBZIz]{Take Cover}action when you are within forest terrain to gain cover, even if you're not next to an obstacle you can take cover behind.</p>
