------ Description (en) ------
<p>You can exert your unsettling presence to subtly Demoralize others. When you do, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language. You also gain the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Ul4I0ER6pj3U5eAk]{Invigorating Fear} reaction. Your alternate form is a fox, which has the statistics of 1st-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gfPjmG6Fe6D3MFjl]{Pest Form}</em>.</p>
