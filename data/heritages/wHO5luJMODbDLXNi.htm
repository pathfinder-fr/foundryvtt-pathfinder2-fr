------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your body proves that shadow can't exist without light. Perhaps your eyes glow brighter or your veins occasionally pulse with light. You emit dim light within 5 feet of you. You can activate or suppress this ability as an action, which has the concentrate trait. Additionally, you can force fragments of your shadow to glow and cast <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.kl2q6JvBZwed4B6v]{Dancing Lights}</em> and <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.WBmvzNDfpwka3qT4]{Light}</em> as occult innate cantrips. Cantrips are heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.</p>
