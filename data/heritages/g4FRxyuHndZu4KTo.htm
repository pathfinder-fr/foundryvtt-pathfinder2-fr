<p>Your lineage has been exposed to curse after curse, and now, they slide off your feathers like rain. If you succeed at a saving throw against a curse or misfortune effect, you get a critical success instead.</p>
<p>When you would gain the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed} condition, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:17] check. On a success, reduce the value of the doomed condition you would gain by 1.</p>
