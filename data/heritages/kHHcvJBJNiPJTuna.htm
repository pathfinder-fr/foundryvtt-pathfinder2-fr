------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your ancestors' exposure to the Shadow Plane wrought great physical changes. Your hair or skin sometimes appears insubstantial, and you're slighter and more agile than other fetchlings. You're <strong>Small</strong> instead of <strong>Medium</strong>. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Acrobatics, the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.3G8xUlgCjRmRJNfP]{Quick Squeeze} skill feat, and a +1 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to Tumble Through. If you would automatically become trained in Acrobatics (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.</p>
