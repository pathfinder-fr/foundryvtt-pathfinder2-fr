------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your ancestors lived in dark spaces underground, granting you dark fur and a vaguely unnatural mien that unnerves sapient creatures and frightens animals. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Intimidation and can use Intimidation to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.tHCqgwjtQtzNqVvd]{Coerce} animals. When you @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.2u915NdUyQan6uKF]{Demoralize} an animal, you don't take a penalty for not sharing a language with it. If you would automatically become trained in Intimidation (from your background or class, for example), you become trained in another skill of your choice.</p>
<p>Animals' attitudes toward you begin one degree worse than normal, usually starting at unfriendly instead of indifferent for domesticated animals, and hostile instead of unfriendly for wild animals.</p>
