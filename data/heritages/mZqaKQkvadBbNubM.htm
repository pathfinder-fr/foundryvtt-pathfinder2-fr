------ Description (en) ------
<p>For tasks that require a lighter touch, gnome, goblin, and halfling remains are more suitable than a larger creature's. These smaller, nimbler skeletons fit well in a traveling chest, can be forced through tight spaces, and more easily avoid detection. Your size is Small instead of Medium. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.3G8xUlgCjRmRJNfP]{Quick Squeeze} feat, even if you aren't trained in Acrobatics. Tight spaces not tight enough to require the Squeeze activity aren't difficult terrain for you.</p>
