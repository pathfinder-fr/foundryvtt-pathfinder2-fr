------ Description (en) ------
<p>You have batlike features, an affinity for batkind, and hearing that is second to none. As long as you can hear normally, you can use the Seek action to sense @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected} creatures in a @Template[type:cone|distance:60] instead of a @Template[type:cone|distance:30]. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to locate undetected creatures that you could hear within 30 feet with a Seek action.</p>
