------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your incredibly small bones allow you to easily compress your body and squeeze through gaps. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.3G8xUlgCjRmRJNfP]{Quick Squeeze} feat as a bonus feat, even if you aren't trained in Acrobatics. Tight spaces not tight enough to require the Squeeze action aren't difficult terrain for you.</p>
