------ Description (en) ------
<p>You have a longer torso and broader shoulders than most hobgoblins, making your legs seem short by comparison. This gives you a strong, muscular core and lowers your center of gravity—features that assist you in riding and climbing—and you've trained at riding in a saddle from an extremely early age. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Rq5wkA8DtsmbzoGV]{Ride} feat. Additionally, you are not @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} while you Climb.</p>
