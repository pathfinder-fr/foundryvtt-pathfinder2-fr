<p><span style="color: #0f0f0f; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #ededed;">Your thoughts and instincts are clouded. Stupefied always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this value on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks and DCs, including Will saving throws, spell attack rolls, spell DCs, and skill checks that use these ability scores. Any time you attempt to Cast a Spell while stupefied, the spell is disrupted unless you succeed at a flat check with a DC equal to 5 + your stupefied value.</span></p>
