------ Description (en) ------
<p>The purple worm can violently regurgitate a creature or boulder it has swallowed to make a ranged Strike. The Strike deals bludgeoning damage depending on the size of the projectile: Tiny deals [[/r {2d6+13}[bludgeoning]]]{2d6+13}, Small [[/r {3d6+13}[bludgeoning]]]{3d6+13}, Medium [[/r {4d6+13}[bludgeoning]]]{4d6+13}, Large [[/r {5d6+13}[bludgeoning]]]{5d6+13}, and Huge [[/r {6d6+13}[bludgeoning]]]{6d6+13}. A regurgitated creature takes falling damage from the height of the target or from 20 feet, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>Boulders occupy space in the worm's stomach as a creature of equivalent size, and purple worms often have several boulders swallowed. A purple worm can use a single action to swallow a new boulder.</p>
