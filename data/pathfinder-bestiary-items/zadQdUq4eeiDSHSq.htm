------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a creature's shadow is pulled free by Steal Shadow, it becomes a @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.XrmHgbKgcHDi4OnK]{Shadow Spawn} under the command of the shadow that created it. This shadow spawn doesn't have Steal Shadow. If the creature the shadow spawn was pulled from dies, the shadow spawn becomes a full-fledged, autonomous shadow. If the creature recovers from its @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeeblement}, its shadow returns to it and the shadow spawn is extinguished.</p>
