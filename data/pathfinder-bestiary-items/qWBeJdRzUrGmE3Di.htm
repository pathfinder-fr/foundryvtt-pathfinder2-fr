<p><strong>Stage 1</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 4} (1 day)</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2</strong> As stage 1 (1 day)</p>
<p><strong>Stage 3</strong> The creature searches for an individual of its own ancestry to kill and devour. It then becomes affected by <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.U0hL0LLaprcnAyzC]{Wind Walk}</em> and sprints into the sky so fast that its feet burn away into jagged stumps. As the creature wind walks into the sky, it is replaced by a new wendigo over [[/br 2d6 #minutes]]{2d6 minutes}.</p>
<p><em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]{Wish}</em>, similar magic, or a 9th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.kqhPt9344UkcGVYO]{Resurrect}</em> ritual can return the victim to life. The new wendigo remains even if the victim is resurrected.</p>
