------ Description (en) ------
<p>The minotaur snorts and clomps as it hunts its prey, inspiring terror. The minotaur makes an Intimidation check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.2u915NdUyQan6uKF]{Demoralize} all living creatures within @Template[type:emanation|distance:60]{60 feet} that can hear the minotaur but not see it. Roll once and apply the result to all creatures. If the targets are in a maze or similarly difficult-to-navigate structure, the minotaur gains a +4 circumstance bonus to this check. Creatures that become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened} as a result also take a -2 circumstance penalty to Survival checks to avoid getting lost for 1 minute. This use of Demoralize doesn't have the visual trait. Each target is temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>
