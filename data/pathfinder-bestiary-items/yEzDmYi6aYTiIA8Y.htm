------ Description (en) ------
<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Trigger</strong> The wendigo casts <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.U0hL0LLaprcnAyzC]{Wind Walk}</em> while it has @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} a foe.</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The wendigo attempts to turn the grabbed creature into wind and carry it along as part of the action. If the target succeeds at a @Check[type:will|dc:38] save, it prevents itself from being transformed; in this case, the wendigo still transforms, automatically releasing the victim.</p>
<p data-visibility="gm">A creature forced to Ride the Wind along with the wendigo is exposed to wendigo torment. The target can attempt a new Will save each round to return to normal, though it immediately becomes corporeal and begins falling if it succeeds.</p>
