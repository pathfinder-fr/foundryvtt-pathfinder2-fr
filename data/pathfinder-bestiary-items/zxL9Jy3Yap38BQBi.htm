------ Description (en) ------
<p>The red dragon attempts to take control of a magical fire or a fire spell within 100 feet.</p>
<p data-visibility="gm">If it succeeds at a counteract check (counteract level 10, counteract modifier +32), the original caster loses control of the spell or magic fire, control is transferred to the dragon, and the dragon counts as having @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.3f5DMFu8fPiqHpRg]{Sustained the Spell} with this action (if applicable). The dragon can choose to end the spell instead of taking control, if it chooses.</p>
