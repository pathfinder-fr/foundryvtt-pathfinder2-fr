Parent Name: Dryad
Name: Tree Meld
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>The dryad touches a tree of enough volume to contain her and merges into it for as long as she wishes. She can Cast a Spell while inside as long as the spell doesn't require a line of effect outside the tree. She can hear, but not see, what's going on outside the tree. She can Dismiss this effect.</p>
<p>Significant physical damage dealt to the tree expels the dryad from the tree and deals [[/r {3d6}]]{3d6 damage} to her. <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.115Xp9E38CJENhNS]{Passwall}</em> expels the dryad without dealing damage.</p>
<p>If a dryad uses this ability on her bonded tree, she instead enters an extradimensional living space within the tree; Tree Meld gains the extradimensional trait. A dryad can bring up to two other creatures with her when entering her home within her bonded tree. The dryad can still be expelled from this space as above.</p>
