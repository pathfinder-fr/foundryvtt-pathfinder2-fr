------ Description (en) ------
<p>A creature damaged by the banshee's touch that isn't already @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened} must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:38] save (@Check[type:will|dc:43] if the attack was a critical hit). If the creature fails its save, it's @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2}; on a critical failure, the creature also cowers with fear and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 4}. If the creature is protected against fear by a spell or magic item, the banshee's touch first attempts to counteract the protection effect, with the effect of a 9th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.9HpwDN4MYQJnW0LG]{Dispel Magic}</em> spell.</p>
