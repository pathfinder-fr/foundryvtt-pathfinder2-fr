<hr />
<p>A creature entering the aura must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:28] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} until the end of its turn (plus @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} for as long as it is sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, an affected creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>
