------ Description (en) ------
<p>With subtle alterations in the pitch and tone of its song, the cauthooj directs one creature @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.yblD8fOR1J8rDwEQ]{Confused} by its Warbling Song to make a Strike. This works like other Strikes made by confused creatures, except that the cauthooj chooses the target. If no target is in reach or range, or the creature is unable to Strike for any other reason, this ability has no effect.</p>
