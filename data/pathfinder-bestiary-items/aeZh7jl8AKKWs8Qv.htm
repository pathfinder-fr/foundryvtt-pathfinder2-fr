------ Description (en) ------
<p>A rust monster's antenna causes metal to rapidly rust and corrode.</p>
<p>If it succeeds at an antenna Strike or Disarm attempt with its antenna, the rust monster deals [[/r {2d6}]]{2d6 damage} (doubled on a critical hit) to a metal item the target is wearing or holding, ignoring its Hardness.</p>
<p>If the rust monster hits an unattended metal item, the item takes this damage automatically.</p>
<p>If a creature uses the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.jM72TjJ965jocBV8]{Shield Block} reaction with a metal shield against an antenna attack, the shield is automatically broken, but no other item is rusted on that attack.</p>
