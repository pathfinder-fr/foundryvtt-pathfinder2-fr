<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Requirement</strong> The shadow hit a living creature with a shadow hand Strike on its previous action.</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The shadow pulls at the target's shadow, making the creature @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled 1}. This is cumulative with other enfeebled conditions from shadows, to a maximum of enfeebled 4. If this increases a creature's enfeebled value to 3 or more, the target's shadow is separated from its body. Enfeebled from Steal Shadow decreases by 1 every hour.</p>
