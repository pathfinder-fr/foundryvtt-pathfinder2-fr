<hr />
<p>Spikes of rock rise up from all stone surfaces in the emanation, creating difficult terrain. A creature moving in the terrain takes [[/r {2d6}[piercing]]]{2d6 piercing damage} for each square of spikes it moves into (a Large or larger creature takes damage only once for each square it moves, even if its space covers multiple squares of spikes). Creatures with the earth trait ignore all effects within the area.</p>
<p>The stone mauler can disable or activate spike stones as a single action, which has the concentrate trait.</p>
