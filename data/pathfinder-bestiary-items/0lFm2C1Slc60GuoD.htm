<p>The raja rakshasa takes on the appearance of any Medium humanoid. This doesn't change the raja rakshasa's Speed or its attack and damage modifiers with its Strikes but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning). It typically loses its fangs Strike unless the humanoid form has fangs or a similar unarmed attack.</p>
