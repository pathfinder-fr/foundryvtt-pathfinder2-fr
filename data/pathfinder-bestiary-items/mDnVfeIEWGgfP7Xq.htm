------ Description (en) ------
<p>While the cassisian isn't particularly intelligent, it has perfect memory and can remember everything it sees or hears. This allows it to attempt @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.1OagaWtBpVXExToo]{Lore} checks on any topic, provided (at the GM's discretion) the cassisian has encountered the topic in question before. The cassisian's limited intellect often prevents it from acting upon its knowledge, making it a better resource than agent in matters of information use.</p>
