------ Description (en) ------
<p>The hydra has @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.lR9R5Vld8Eu2Dha5]{Regeneration} equal to 3 x the number of heads it has. If a hydra's body is missing any heads and the remaining stumps have not been cauterized, the hydra attempts a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:25] save after it regains Hit Points from regeneration. On a success, one uncauterized stump regrows two heads; on a critical success, two uncauterized stumps regrow into two heads each. The hydra can never grow more than double the number of heads it ordinarily has. The hydra's regeneration only fully deactivates if all its heads are severed and all stumps are cauterized, at which point it dies.</p>
