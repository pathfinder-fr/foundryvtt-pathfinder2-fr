------ Description (en) ------
<p>When the black pudding is hit by an attack that would deal slashing or piercing damage and has 10 or more HP, it splits into two identical puddings, each with half the original's HP.</p>
<p>One pudding is in the same space as the original, and the other appears in an adjacent unoccupied space. If no adjacent space is unoccupied, it automatically pushes creatures and objects out of the way to fill a space (the GM decides if an object or creature is too big or sturdy to push).</p>
