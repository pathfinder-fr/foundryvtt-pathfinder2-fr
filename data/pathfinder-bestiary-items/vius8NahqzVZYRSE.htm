<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Requirements</strong> The satyr is holding a musical instrument.</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The satyr plays a melody on his instrument to cast <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.vLA0q0WOK2YPuJs6]{Charm}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.4koZzrnMXhhosn0D]{Fear}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.o4lRVTwSxnOOn5vl]{Sleep}</em>, or <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.qwlh6aDgi86U3Q7H]{Suggestion}</em> without expending the spell slot and using his music in place of providing the spell's component actions. The spell gains the auditory trait and targets all creatures in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:60] instead of its usual targets. A creature that succeeds at its Will save against any spell is then temporarily immune from spells played from that satyr's pipes for 1 minute. Satyrs are immune to this music.</p>
