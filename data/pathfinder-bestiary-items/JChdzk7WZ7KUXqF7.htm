------ Description (en) ------
<p>A peck from a cockatrice hardens the flesh of the creature struck. The target must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:20] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} (or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 2} on a critical failure). Further failed saves against calcification increase the slowed condition. Once a creature's actions are reduced to 0 by calcification, that creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dTwPJuKgBQCMxixg]{Petrified}.</p>
<p>Every 24 hours after it was petrified, the victim can attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:20] save to recover. On a success, it becomes flesh again, but is slowed 1 for the next 24 hours. On a critical success, the creature recovers and isn't slowed. On a failure, the creature remains petrified, but can try again in 24 hours. On a critical failure, the petrification is permanent, and the creature can't attempt any more saves.</p>
