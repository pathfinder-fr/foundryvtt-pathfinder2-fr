<p>After the dragon uses its Breath Weapon, a fierce blizzard of blinding snow surrounds its body for 1 round. Everything in the aura is diffcult terrain for other creatures that are on the ground, climbing, or flying. The blowing snow also makes all creatures in the area @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed}. While the blizzard rages, the dragon's dragon chill extends to the full area of the blizzard.</p>
