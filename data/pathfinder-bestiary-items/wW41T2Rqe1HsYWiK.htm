Name: Repair Mode
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>When the adamantine golem is at 0 HP, it isn't destroyed. Instead, it enters repair mode, during which it is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}, can't take reactions, and can take only the Self-Repair action.</p>
<p>Once it has more than 30 HP, it can use any type of action and can use reactions, though it remains slowed 1 and can't take any reactions until the start of its next turn.</p>
<p>If a critical hit with an adamantine <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.6xaxxKfvXED6LfIY]{Vorpal}</em> weapon reduces the golem to 0 HP, or if such a weapon hits it while it's already at 0 HP, then the golem is destroyed.</p>
