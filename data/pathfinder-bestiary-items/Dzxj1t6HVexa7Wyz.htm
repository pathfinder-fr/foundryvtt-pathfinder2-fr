------ Description (en) ------
<p>A creature hit by a warsworn's scrap ball Strike must attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:37] save. On a failure, the target falls @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone}; if the target was airborne, it falls up to 120 feet, taking damage from the fall and landing prone if the descent brings it to the ground. On a critical failure, the target is also held under a pile of scrap (DC 37 to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escape}).</p>
