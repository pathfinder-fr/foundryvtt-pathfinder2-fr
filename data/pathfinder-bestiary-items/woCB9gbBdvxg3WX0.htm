------ Description (en) ------
<p>The bulette attempts a @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.2HJ4yuEFY1Cast4h]{High Jump} or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.JUvAvruz7yRQXfz2]{Long Jump}. If it's adjacent to an enemy at the apex of its High Jump or at the end of its Long Jump, it can make a claw Strike against the enemy at that moment. If the bulette jumps at least 5 feet vertically or at least 20 feet horizontally, it can attempt two claw Strikes instead of one. The bulette's multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until it has made all the claw Strikes that are part of its Leaping Charge.</p>
