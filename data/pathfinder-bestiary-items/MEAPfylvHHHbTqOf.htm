Parent Name: Boggard Warrior
Name: Tongue Grab
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>If the boggard warrior hits a creature with its tongue, that creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} by the boggard. Unlike with a normal grab, the creature isn't @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized}, but it can't move beyond the reach of the boggard's tongue.</p>
<p data-visibility="gm">A creature can sever the tongue by hitting AC 15 and dealing at least 3 slashing damage. Though this doesn't deal any damage to the boggard, it prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week.</p>
