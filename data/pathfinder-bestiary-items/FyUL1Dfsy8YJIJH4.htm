------ Description (en) ------
<p>Any creature hit by a roper's strand is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled 1} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed}. Each additional hit from a strand increases the enfeebled condition value by 1 (to a maximum of enfeebled 4). This enfeebled value decreases by 1 every 8 hours. The roper can move while it has a creature grabbed with a strand, but it automatically releases the creature if it moves beyond the strand's reach. The roper can release an grabbed creature as a free action. A creature can sever a strand with a target attack that hits AC 27 and deals at least 18 slashing damage. This doesn't deal any damage to the roper itself, though it can no longer attack with a severed strand.</p>
