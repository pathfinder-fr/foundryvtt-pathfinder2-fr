------ Description (en) ------
<p>The nosoi croons an entrancing song. Each living or undead creature within a @Template[type:emanation|distance:60] must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:18] save.</p>
<p>The effect lasts for 1 round, but a nosoi can use this ability again on subsequent rounds to extend the duration by 1 round for all affected creatures. A creature that succeeds at any save is temporarily immune for 24 hours. Despite being a mental effect, this ability affects mindless undead. Psychopomps are immune to this ability.</p>
<div data-visibility="gm"><hr />
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AdPVz7rbaVSRxHFg]{Fascinated}.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, and the creature must spend each of its actions on its turn to move closer to the nosoi as expediently as possible while avoiding obvious dangers. If a @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AdPVz7rbaVSRxHFg]{Fascinated} creature is adjacent to the nosoi, it stays still and doesn't act. If the creature is attacked, the fascination ends.</p>
