------ Description (en) ------
<p>The uthul transforms itself into a swirling vortex of storm and fury 10 feet wide and up to 40 feet tall. It stays in this form for 3 rounds or until it Dismisses the effect. While in this form, the uthul gains resistance 10 to physical damage and can move through other creatures.</p>
<p>Its aura remains active, but it can't make debris Strikes nor use Lightning Crash. Instead, any creature the uthul moves through takes [[/r {4d6}[bludgeoning]]]{4d6 bludgeoning damage} and [[/r {2d12}[electricity]]]{2d12 electricity damage}. A creature can take this damage only once per round. A Large or smaller creature must also succeed at a @Check[type:reflex|dc:32] save or be picked up and held suspended within the vortex. Suspended creatures move with the uthul. A creature can attempt to escape by spending an action to attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:32] save (or a <span data-pf2-action="maneuverInFlight" data-pf2-dc="32" data-pf2-label="Whirlwind Form DC" data-pf2-glyph="A" data-pf2-show-dc="gm">Acrobatics</span> check to maneuver in flight if it has a fly Speed). Upon escaping, or when the uthul transforms back into its storm cloud form, a suspended creature is hurled [[/br 1d4*10]]{1d4 x 10 feet} in a random direction, then falls unless it can fly or otherwise remain aloft.</p>
<p data-visibility="gm">After returning to its normal form, the uthul must wait 1 minute before it can use Whirlwind Form again.</p>
