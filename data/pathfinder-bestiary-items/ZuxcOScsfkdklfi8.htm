------ Description (en) ------
<p>A baomal can inhale tremendous amounts of water, drawing everything in the sea nearby closer. All creatures and objects in the water within @Template[type:emanation|distance:60]{60 feet} of the baomal (including ships) are pulled toward it. Creatures must succeed at a @Check[type:athletics|dc:42] check or be pulled up to 20 feet toward the baomal (40 feet on a critical failure). For ships, use the captain's Sailing Lore in place of Athletics. Unattended objects are automatically pulled.</p>
