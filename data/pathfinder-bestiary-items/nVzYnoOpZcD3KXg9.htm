------ Description (en) ------
<p>A legion archon's spirit of righteousness manifests in its hands as a mighty two-handed sword called the flame of justice.</p>
<p>A legion archon can throw its flame of justice as a ranged weapon. If disarmed or thrown, the flame of justice vanishes after landing or dealing damage and reappears in the legion archon's hands again instantly.</p>
<p>On a critical hit, the fire damage from the flame of justice deals maximum damage ([[/r {6}[fire]]]{6} on the d6) before being doubled for the critical hit, and the target takes [[/r {1d10}[persistent,fire]]] @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Fire Damage}.</p>
