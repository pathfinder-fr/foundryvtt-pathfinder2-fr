------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a leaf leshy dies, a burst of primal energy explodes from its body, restoring [[/r {1d4}[healing]]]{1d4 Hit Points} to each plant creature in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]. This area is filled with tree saplings, becoming difficult terrain. If the terrain is not a viable environment for these trees, they wither after 24 hours.</p>
