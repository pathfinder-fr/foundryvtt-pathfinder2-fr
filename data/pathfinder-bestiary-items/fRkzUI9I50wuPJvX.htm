------ Description (en) ------
<p>The gogiteth Strides three times. Once per Stride, it can attempt a leg Strike against a creature in its reach at any point during the Stride; it must make each attack against a different creature, but it doesn't apply its multiple attack penalty until after making all its Strikes. If any of the Strikes result in a critical failure, Skittering Assault ends.</p>
