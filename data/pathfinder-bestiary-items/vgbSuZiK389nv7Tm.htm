<p><strong>Effect</strong> The succubus on can give a willing humanoid a profane gift. That creature gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. As long as the gift persists, the succubus can communicate telepathically with the target at any distance, see through the creature's senses, and target the creature with <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.qwlh6aDgi86U3Q7H]{Suggestion}</em> through the telepathic link. In addition, the creature uses an outcome one degree of success worse than it rolls on saving throws against the lust demon's <em>suggestion</em>.</p>
<p>A humanoid can't have more than one profane gift at a time, and a succubus can't grant more than one profane gift at a time. Removing the gift requires an <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.7Fd4lxozd11MQ55N]{Atone}</em> ritual. The succubus can remove the gift as a free action to give the recipient a permanent @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 3} condition. A 4th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.SnaLVgxZ9ryUFmUr]{Restoration}</em> spell is required to reduce this stupefied condition by 1. A summoned succubus can't grant a profane gift.</p>
