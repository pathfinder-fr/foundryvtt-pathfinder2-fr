------ Description (en) ------
<p>The invisible stalker is invisible at all times, though when it takes a hostile action of any kind, it is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} instead of @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected} until the start of its next turn, as the vague outline of its humanoid form is faintly visible for a short period of time.</p>
