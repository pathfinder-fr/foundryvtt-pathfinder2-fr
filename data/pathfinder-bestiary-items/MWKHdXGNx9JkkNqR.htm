------ Description (en) ------
<p>Pleromas care little for communication with other creatures, but when they do convey information, they do so wordlessly through a series of psychic projections. This acts as @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.kdhbPaBMK1d1fpbA]{Telepathy} with a range of 100 feet but is understandable to all creatures regardless of whether they have a language, though the aeon's meaning to non-aeons can be vague and is often mysterious.</p>
<p>An aeon can use this ability to communicate flawlessly with any other aeon on the same plane as itself.</p>
