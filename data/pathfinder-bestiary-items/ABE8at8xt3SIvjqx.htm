------ Description (en) ------
<p>The grikkitog implants its core into an adjacent section of earth or stone, melding seamlessly and changing its visual appearance to match the surrounding rock. It's @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} but automatically succeeds at its Deception check to Impersonate the stone around it; creatures actively searching for it can still attempt Perception checks against its Deception DC as normal. A grikkitog can release its implantation as a free action, which has the manipulate trait. A grikkitog's infestation aura and manifold vision are only active while implanted.</p>
