------ Description (en) ------
<p>The ghost laments its fate, forcing each living creature within @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]{30 feet} to attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:21] save. On a failure, a creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2} (or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 3} on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this ghost's frightful moan for 1 minute.</p>
