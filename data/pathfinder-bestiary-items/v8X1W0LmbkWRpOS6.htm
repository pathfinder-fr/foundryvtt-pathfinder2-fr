<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Requirement</strong> The poltergeist must be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible}.</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The poltergeist becomes visible, appearing as a skeletal, ghostlike humanoid. Each creature within @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]{30 feet} must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:21] save, becoming @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2} on a failure. On a critical failure, it's also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} for as long as it's frightened. On a success, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute. At the start of its next turn, the poltergeist becomes invisible again.</p>
