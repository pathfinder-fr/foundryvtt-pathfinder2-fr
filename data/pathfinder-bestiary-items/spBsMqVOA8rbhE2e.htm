<hr />
<p>Plants near Treerazer twist, deform, and transform into thorny or fungoid parodies of their natural shapes. A living creature in this area must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:47] save each round or become partially transformed into plantlike matter. Those who fail this saving throw are treated as if they were plants for the purposes of any effect that particularly harms or inconveniences plant creatures more than other creatures, but do not gain any benefits of being plant creatures. This effect lasts as long as the creature remains within the area of corruption and for 1 minute thereafter.</p>
