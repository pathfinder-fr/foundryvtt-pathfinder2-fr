------ Description (en) ------
<p>The marilith attacks a single target with all the weapons they wield in their arms, overwhelming the target with multiple attacks and leaving almost nowhere to dodge. The demon makes a longsword Strike. On a successful attack, the marilith deals longsword damage to the target, plus an additional [[/r {1d8}[slashing]]]{1d8 slashing damage} for every longsword they wield beyond the first (typically [[/r {5d8}[slashing]]]{5d8 extra slashing damage}). Even on a failed attack, the marilith deals the damage from one longsword to the target, though they still miss completely on a critical failure. This counts toward the marilith's multiple attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number of longswords the pride demon wields.</p>
