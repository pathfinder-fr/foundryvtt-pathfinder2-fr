------ Description (en) ------
<p>A skulltaker taps into the memories of the creatures whose bones make up its body. This gives it the Skeletal Lore skill, which it can use to Recall Knowledge of any kind. In addition, it can speak and understand all the languages known by the creatures whose bones make up its body (typically including Common and the regional language of the skulltakerʼs home region). The skulltaker can use Skeletal Lore as the primary skill check for the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.hp6Q64dl7xbdn4gQ]{Legend Lore}</em> ritual, and it can cast <em>legend lore</em> without secondary casters.</p>
