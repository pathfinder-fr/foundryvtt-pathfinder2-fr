------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a graveknight is destroyed, its armor rebuilds its body over the course of [[/br 1d10 #days]]{1d10 days}-or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host. If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts.</p>
<p>A graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating its armor (such as with <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.r7ihOgKv19eJQnik]{Disintegrate}</em>), transporting it to the Positive Energy Plane, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano.</p>
