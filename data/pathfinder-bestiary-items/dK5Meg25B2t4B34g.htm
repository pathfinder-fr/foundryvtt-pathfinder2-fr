------ Description (en) ------
<p>As succubi are beings of pure lust, creatures that reject their lust can metaphysically harm them. When a succubus fails a Diplomacy check to Embrace or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.DCb62iCBrJXy0Ik6]{Request}, or when a creature succeeds at its save against a succubus's mental spell or ability, the succubus takes [[/r {2d6}[mental]]]{2d6 mental damage}. For one hour after causing mental damage to a succubus in this way, a creature can deal [[/r {2d6}[mental]]]{2d6 mental damage} to the succubus with a successful @Compendium[pf2e.action-macros.nEwqNNWX6scLt4sc]{Demoralize} incorporating its rejection.</p>
