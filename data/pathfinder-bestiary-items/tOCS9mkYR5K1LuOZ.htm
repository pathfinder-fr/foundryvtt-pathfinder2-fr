------ Description (en) ------
<p>The basilisk stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. That creature must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:22] save. If it fails and has not already been slowed by Petrifying Glance or this ability, it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}. If the creature was already slowed by this ability or Petrifying Glance, a failed save causes the creature to be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dTwPJuKgBQCMxixg]{Petrified} permanently.</p>
<p>A creature petrified in this manner that is coated (not just splashed) with fresh basilisk blood (taken from a basilisk that has been dead no longer than 1 hour) is instantly restored to flesh.</p>
<p>A single basilisk contains enough blood to coat [[/br 1d3 #Medium Creatures]]{1d3 Medium creatures} in this manner.</p>
