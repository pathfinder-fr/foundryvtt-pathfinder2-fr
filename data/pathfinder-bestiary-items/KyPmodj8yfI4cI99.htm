<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Requirements</strong> The astradaemon hasn't used an action with the attack trait yet this turn.</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The astradaemon draws out and consumes the soul of a living creature it has @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed}. The creature must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:35] save or instantly die. If it dies, the astradaemon gains 10 temporary Hit Points and a +2 status bonus to attack and damage rolls for 1 minute, or for 1 day if the victim was 15th level or higher. A victim slain in this way can be returned to life normally. A creature that survives is temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>
