------ Description (en) ------
<p>The river drake spits a ball of caustic mucus up to a range of 50 feet that explodes in a @Template[type:burst|distance:10]. Creatures within the burst take [[/r {4d6}[acid]]]{4d6 acid damage} (@Check[type:reflex|dc:19|basic:true] save). Those that fail this save also take @Localize[PF2E.PersistentDamage.Acid1d6.success] and take a -5-foot status penalty to their Speed. This Speed reduction ends with the persistent acid damage.</p>
<p data-visibility="gm">The river drake can't use Caustic Mucus again for [[/br 1d6 #Recharge Caustic Mucus]]{1d6 rounds}.</p>
