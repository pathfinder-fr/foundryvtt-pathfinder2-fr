------ Description (en) ------
<p>Three times per day, a pleroma can manifest a 2-foot-diameter sphere of complete and utter darkness that hovers above its right hand. By using a single action, which has the concentrate trait, the pleroma can cause the sphere to fly 10 feet. The sphere can move in any direction, ignoring difficult terrain, but it can't move farther than 300 feet away from the pleroma.</p>
<p>The sphere is an empty void that lasts for 1 minute before collapsing in on itself and winking out of existence.</p>
<p>Once manifested, the sphere can be used as a ranged attack, but it blinks out of existence immediately after that attack is resolved. Any unattended object that touches the void is sucked in and completely destroyed. Larger objects (such as ships or buildings) are destroyed at a rate of one 10-foot cube per round of contact.</p>
<p>The sphere can enter the space of a creature; when it does, the creature must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:43] save or be absorbed into the sphere. On a successful save, the creature is pushed to a space of the GM's choice away from the sphere. Those who fail take [[/r {20d6}[negative]]]{20d6 negative damage} (even to undead) and are pushed away as a success. Those who critically fail, or are reduced to 0 HP by the damage from a failure, are annihilated and can be restored only via a 10th-level spell.</p>
