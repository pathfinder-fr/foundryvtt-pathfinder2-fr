------ Description (en) ------
<p>The medusa fixes their glare at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The target must immediately attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:25] save against the medusa's petrifying gaze. If the creature was already @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed} by petrifying gaze before attempting its save, a failed save causes it to be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dTwPJuKgBQCMxixg]{Petrified} permanently.</p>
<p>After attempting its save, the creature is then temporarily immune until the start of the medusa's next turn.</p>
