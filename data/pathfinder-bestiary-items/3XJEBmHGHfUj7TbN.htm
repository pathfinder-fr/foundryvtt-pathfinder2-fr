<hr />
<p>Each non-grothlut creature that enters or starts its turn within the area must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:17] saving throw or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} (@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 2} on a critical failure). The creature then becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>
<p>The grothlut can activate or deactivate the aura by using a single free action that has the concentrate trait. A grothlut usually does not begin moaning until it senses the presence of a non-grothlut creature, and it usually stops once it doesn't sense any more such creatures.</p>
