------ Description (en) ------
<p>When casting <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.WzLKjSw6hsBhuklC]{Create Water}</em>, the dragon can attempt to destroy liquid instead of creating it, turning an equal amount of liquid into sand. This destroys liquid magic or alchemical items if they're of a lower level than the dragon (a creature can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:32] save to protect all liquids in its possession). This doesn't affect the liquids in a creature's body.</p>
