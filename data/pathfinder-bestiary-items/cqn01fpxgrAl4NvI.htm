------ Description (en) ------
<p>A living humanoid slain by a wraith's spectral hand Strike rises as a @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.HbROgIcU9Z9m6XuD]{Wraith Spawn} after [[/br 1d4 #Wraith Spawn Transformation]]{1d4 rounds}. This wraith spawn is under the command of the wraith that killed it. It doesn't have drain life or wraith spawn and becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.i3OJZU2nk64Df3xm]{Clumsy 2} for as long as it is a wraith spawn. If the creator of the wraith spawn dies, the wraith spawn becomes a full-fledged, autonomous wraith; it regains its free will, gains Wraith Spawn, and is no longer clumsy.</p>
