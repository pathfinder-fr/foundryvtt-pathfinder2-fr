------ Description (en) ------
<p>The ice devil channels the extreme cold of its body through its appendages and weapons. A creature hit by an ice devil's weapon or unarmed attack in melee must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:32] save or be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}. A weapon used by an ice devil gains the effects of a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.M5M1WJ5KzbYfRGsY]{Frost rune} while the gelugon holds it, and the ice devil can throw any such weapon with a 20-foot range increment, trailing motes of frost.</p>
