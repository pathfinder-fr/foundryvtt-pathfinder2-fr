<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> The elananx takes damage from a hostile source.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The elananx disperses into a cloud of smoke and cinders, filling its space and a @Template[type:emanation|distance:20]. While in this form, the elananx can't be attacked or targeted, and it doesn't take up space. Anything inside this cloud is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed}, and any creature ending its turn there takes [[/r {2d6}[fire]]]{2d6 fire damage}. At the start of its turn, the elananx returns to its normal form in any square the cloud covered. If the elananx Strikes a creature using its first action after returning to its normal form, the target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} and the Strike deals an extra [[/r {1d6}[fire]]]{1d6 fire damage}.</p>
