------ Description (en) ------
<p>When the dancer dies, their body combusts in a flare of white light. All creatures in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10] must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:17] save<span data-visibility="gm"> or be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}</span>.</p>
<p data-visibility="gm">Calignis that fail this save are also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 1}. The dancer's gear and treasure are left in a pile where they died. As this isn't a magical effect, the light has no effect within magical darkness.</p>
