------ Description (en) ------
<p>When the keketar casts <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.HBJPsonQnWcC3qdX]{Hallucinatory Terrain}</em>, it infuses the illusion with quasi-real substance. Creatures that do not disbelieve the illusion treat structures and terrain created through the spell as though they were real, ascending illusory stairs, becoming trapped by illusory quicksand, and so on.</p>
