------ Description (en) ------
<p>Any ability that would sever a chimera's head (such as a critical hit with a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.6xaxxKfvXED6LfIY]{Vorpal Weapon}</em>) severs one head at random. Losing a head doesn't kill a chimera (as long as it has one head left), but it does prevent it from making Strikes with the lost head or using the head's Breath Weapon.</p>
