------ Description (en) ------
<p>If a night hag is ethereal and hovering over a sleeping chaotic or evil creature, she can ride the victim's back until dawn. The creature endures tormenting dreams as the hag casts <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Uqj344bezBq3ESdq]{Nightmare}</em> on it, and is exposed to abyssal plague. Any drained caused by dream haunting is cumulative.</p>
<p>Only an ethereal being can confront the night hag and stop her dream haunting.</p>
