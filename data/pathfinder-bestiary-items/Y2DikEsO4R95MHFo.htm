<p>When a fungus leshy dies, a burst of primal energy explodes from its body, restoring [[/r {2d8}[healing]]]{2d8 Hit Points} to each fungi creature in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]. This area is filled with fungi, becoming difficult terrain. If the terrain is not a viable environment for this fungi, they wither after 24 hours.</p>
