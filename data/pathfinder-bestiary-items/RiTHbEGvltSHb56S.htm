------ Description (en) ------
<p>The contract devil produces an infernal contract for a single living mortal. This contract can grant a wide range of abilities and effects, akin to the power of a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]{Wish}</em> spell but fulfilled to the letter by the contract devil. To receive any of those benefits, the mortal must willingly sign its true name to the contract. At that point, the mortal's soul is bound to the contract devil and Hell.</p>
<p>While the contract is in effect, the victim can't be restored to life except by <em>wish</em> or similar magic. If the mortal is restored to life by those means, the contract devil knows which mortal came to life and can locate the creature or creatures who restored the mortal to life for 1 year, gaining the effects of a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.LQzlKbYjZSMFQawP]{Locate}</em> spell with unlimited range. Avoiding the terms of an infernal contract is difficult and often dangerous.</p>
