------ Description (en) ------
<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Frequency</strong> Three times per day</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The wendigo unleashes a forlorn howl that can be heard up to 1 mile away. Any creature that hears the howl must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:38] save<span data-visibility="gm"> or be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 1}. Any creature that critically fails and is within 120 feet of the wendigo is instead @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 3}, and is also fleeing for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds} (or until it's no longer frightened, whichever comes first)</span>.</p>
<div data-visibility="gm">
<p>A creature frightened by a wendigo's howl still naturally recovers from its fright but can't reduce it below frightened 1 in this way until 1 hour has passed or magic is used.</p>
<p>Whether it succeeds or fails its save, a creature is then temporarily immune to that wendigo's Howl for 24 hours.</p>
