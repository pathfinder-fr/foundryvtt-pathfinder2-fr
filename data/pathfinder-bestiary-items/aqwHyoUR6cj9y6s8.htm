------ Description (en) ------
<p>The shemhazian focuses their gaze on a non-evil creature they can see within 30 feet. If that creature isn't already @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed} by the shemhazian's paralyzing gaze, it must attempt a save against the shemhazian's paralyzing gaze. If that creature is slowed, it must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:35] save or be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed} for 1 round. A shemhazian can't use this ability against the same creature more than once per round.</p>
