------ Description (en) ------
<p>The poltergeist telekinetically throws numerous small objects, such as dozens of pieces of silverware or books, either spreading them out among multiple foes or directing them at one target.</p>
<ul>
<li>When this effect is spread out among multiple foes, the poltergeist makes a telekinetic object Strike at a -2 penalty against each creature within @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]{30 feet}. These count as one attack for the poltergeist's multiple attack penalty, and the penalty doesn't increase until after all the attacks.</li>
<li>When this effect has only one target, the poltergeist makes a telekinetic object Strike against the target, and the damage increases to [[/r {3d12}]]{3d12 damage}. It deals [[/r {1d12}]]{1d12 damage} on a failure, and no damage on a critical failure.</li>
</ul>
