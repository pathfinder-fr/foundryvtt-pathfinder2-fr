------ Description (en) ------
<p>Any ability that would sever a baomal's head (such as a critical hit with a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.6xaxxKfvXED6LfIY]{Vorpal}</em> weapon) severs one head at random. Losing one head doesn't kill a baomal, but it does prevent the baomal from making Strikes with the lost head and from using Double Opportunity or Two-Headed Strike.</p>
