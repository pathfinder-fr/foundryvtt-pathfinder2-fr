------ Description (en) ------
<p>The vrock emits a cloud of spores from their body, dealing [[/r {2d8}[poison]]]{2d8 poison damage} to all adjacent creatures. Each creature damaged this way must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:28|traits:damaging-effect] save or take [[/r {2d8}[persistent,piercing]]] @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Piercing Damage} as the spores penetrate its skin and grow into thick, green vines. The vines cease growing after 10 rounds, and they wither away in [[/br 1d4 #Spore Cloud Duration]]{1d4 days} if not shaved off before then. The vines can be destroyed if the creature is affected by a good spell or if <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.efFe4EK7ThUrH446]{Holy Water}</em> is applied to the vines (with an Interact action).</p>
<p data-visibility="gm">Once the vrock uses Spore Cloud, the ability can't be used for [[/br 1d6 #Recharge Spore Cloud]]{1d6 rounds}.</p>
