------ Description (en) ------
<p>Once per day, an annis hag can cause a cage built of cold iron fingernails to spring out of nothingness at a range of up to 30 feet, attempting an @Check[type:athletics|traits:action:grapple|overrideTraits:true] check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.PMbdMWc2QroouFGD]{Grapple} against the target's Fortitude DC; if the target has a weakness to cold iron, the annis hag gains a +2 circumstance bonus to this check.</p>
<p>Unlike a normal Grapple, the annis hag doesn't need to be within reach and can move as she pleases, and a successful attempt lasts until the creature escapes (DC 24), causing the cage to crumble into rust.</p>
<p>Any creature can attempt to destroy the cage by attacking it. It has an AC of 19, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points.</p>
