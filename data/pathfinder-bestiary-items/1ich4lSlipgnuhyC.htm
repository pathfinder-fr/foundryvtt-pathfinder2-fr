<hr />
<p>Living creatures are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 1} while in a mummy guardian's despair aura. They can't naturally recover from this fear while in the area but recover instantly once they leave the area. When a creature first enters the area, it must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:22] save (after taking the penalty from being frightened) or be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed} for 1 round. The creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>
