------ Description (en) ------
<p>A gelatinous cube is so clear that it's difficult to spot. A successful @Check[type:perception|dc:23|traits:action:search] check is required to notice a stationary cube, and a creature must be @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.TiNDYUGlMmxzxBYU]{Searching} to attempt this check.</p>
<p>A creature that walks into the cube is automatically Engulfed (this usually causes the GM to call for initiative).</p>
