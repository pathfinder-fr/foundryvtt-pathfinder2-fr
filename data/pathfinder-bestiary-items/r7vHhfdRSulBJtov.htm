------ Description (en) ------
<p>A glabrezu's lies sustain them, and the truth can destroy them. Whenever a revelation effect counteracts or reveals the glabrezu's illusions or the glabrezu fails a save against an effect that would prevent them from lying (such as <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.aewxsale5xWEPKLk]{Zone of Truth}</em>), the demon takes [[/r {3d6}[mental]]]{3d6 mental damage}. They take this damage only once per effect, even if the effect reveals multiple illusions or prevents multiple lies.</p>
