------ Description (en) ------
<p>A marilith's pride feeds their strength, so the sting of failure wounds them. If the marilith uses a damaging spell or makes a Strike on their turn but doesn't deal any damage that turn, they take [[/r {3d6+10}[mental]]]{3d6+10 mental damage} at the end of their turn and their commander's aura deactivates until the end of their next turn.</p>
