------ Description (en) ------
<p>The lamia matriarch can take on the appearance of a Medium humanoid. This doesn't change their Speed or their attack and damage modifiers with their Strikes, but it does prevent them from using their cursed touch. Each lamia matriarch has a fixed humanoid form-they cannot adopt a different appearance each time they use this ability, and the appearance resembles that of their upper torso when in their true form.</p>
