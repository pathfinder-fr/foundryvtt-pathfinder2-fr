------ Description (en) ------
<p>The bugbear tormentor makes a dazzling series of attacks with two weapons, using the first attack to throw their foe off guard against a second attack at a different angle. They make one Strike with each of their two melee weapons, both against the same target. The target is automatically @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} against the second attack. Apply the bugbear tormentor's multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally.</p>
