------ Description (en) ------
<p>The otyugh attempts to move all creatures that it has @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} into other spaces within the reach of its tentacles, rolling a single @Check[type:athletics] check and comparing the result against each creature's Fortitude DC. On a failure, the creature remains in place, and on a critical failure, the creature is no longer grabbed.</p>
