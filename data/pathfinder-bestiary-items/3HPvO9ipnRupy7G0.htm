------ Description (en) ------
<p>A shield archon's shield is the focal point of its courage and soul. It always has its shield raised without needing to @Compendium[pf2e.action-macros.4hfQEMiEOBbqelAh]{Raise a Shield}, and it can use @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.m4HQ2o5aPxjXf2kY]{Shield Block} as a free action instead of a reaction (Hardness 10, HP 80). A shield archon can trigger its Shield Block free action when an ally within 10 feet is the target of an attack, reducing damage to that ally instead of itself but otherwise following the normal rules of Shield Block.</p>
