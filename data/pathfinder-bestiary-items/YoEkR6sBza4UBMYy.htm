------ Description (en) ------
<p>When an astradaemon hits with its claw, jaws, or tail, it drains the target's spiritual and vital essences. The target takes [[/r {2d10}[negative]]]{2d10 negative energy damage} and the astradaemon regains an equal number of Hit Points. The target must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:37] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed 1} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1}. If the target was already drained or doomed, it instead increases both conditions' value by 1, to a maximum of 4.</p>
