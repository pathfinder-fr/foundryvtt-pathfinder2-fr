<p><strong>Effect</strong> Ten blight quartz gemstones on the demilich's skull can trap the souls of the living. The Activated gem casts <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.GYmXvS9NJ7QwfWGg]{Bind Soul}</em>. This bind soul can target and affect a dying creature instead of a corpse. The dying creature can attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:38] save; if it succeeds, it doesn't die and its soul is not trapped but it's @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 2} (or is unaffected entirely on a critical success). When the soul of a creature gets trapped, the creature's body swiftly turns to dust.</p>
<p>The gemstones work like the black sapphires used in <em>bind soul</em>, except that they can hold creatures of up to 17th level and have a value of 200 gp apiece. The demilich can Devour a Soul it has trapped.</p>
