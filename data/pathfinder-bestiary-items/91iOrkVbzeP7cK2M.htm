------ Description (en) ------
<p>The mimic is coated in an adhesive slime. Any creature that hits the mimic, is hit by the mimic, or otherwise touches the mimic must succeed at a @Check[type:reflex|dc:23] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} (Escape DC 23). A weapon that hits the mimic is stuck to the mimic and can be removed with a successful @Check[type:athletics|dc:23] check (made as a single action).</p>
<p>A mimic can have any number of objects or creatures stuck to it at a time. The mimic can release a stuck creature or object by using a single action, and the adhesive dissolves 1 minute after the mimic dies, releasing all stuck objects and creatures.</p>
