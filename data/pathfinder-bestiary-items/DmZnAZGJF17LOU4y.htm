<p><strong>Effect</strong> A ghaele's blade is implacable in the pursuit of freedom, and its energies can overpower any effect that would interfere with its swordplay. The ghaele attempts to counteract each effect that prevents it from making a greatsword Strike, gives it a penalty to its greatsword Strike, or prevents it from acting. The ghaele can use this ability even if it's otherwise unable to act.</p>
