------ Description (en) ------
<p>Once per day, a cacodaemon can ingest the soul of a sentient creature within 30 feet that died within the last minute. When it does, the cacodaemon grows a fist-sized soul gem (Hardness 2, HP 8) in its gut and can regurgitate it at any time as an Interact action.</p>
<p>Destroying the gem frees the soul within but does not return the deceased creature to life. The caster of a spell to return a creature to life whose soul is trapped within a soul gem must succeed at a @Check[type:religion|dc:30] check. On a success, the soul gem shatters and the creature is returned to life as normal for the spell.</p>
<p>By using an Interact action, a fiend can ingest a soul gem it is holding, condemning the soul to the fiend's home plane. The fiend gains @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.fJSNOw4zHGbIm4bZ]{Fast Healing 5} for 1 minute.</p>
