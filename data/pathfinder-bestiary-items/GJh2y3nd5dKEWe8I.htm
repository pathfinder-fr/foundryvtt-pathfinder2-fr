------ Description (en) ------
<p>An astradaemon bends light, appearing shifted from its true position, though still in the same space. Creatures targeting the astradaemon must attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:11] check, as if the astradaemon were @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden}, even though it remains @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.1wQY3JYyhMYeeV2G]{Observed}. Effects such as the Blind-Fight feat and halfling's keen eyes that apply on the flat check against hidden creatures also apply against a displaced astradaemon.</p>
