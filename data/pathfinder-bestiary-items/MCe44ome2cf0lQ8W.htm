------ Description (en) ------
<p>The mukradi makes two Strikes with different maws against the same target. If both hit, the target takes an extra [[/r {2d12+13}[slashing]]]{2d12+13 slashing damage}, with a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:36|basic:true] save. On a critical failure, the creature is torn to pieces and dies. The mukradi's multiple attack penalty increases only after all the attacks are made.</p>
