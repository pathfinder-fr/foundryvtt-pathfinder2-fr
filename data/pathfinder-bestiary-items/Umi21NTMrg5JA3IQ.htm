------ Description (en) ------
<p>A living humanoid slain by a wight's claw Strike rises as a @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.ZPjQkKVMi3xoPcU0]{Wight Spawn} after [[/br 1d4 #Wight Spawn Transformation]]{1d4 rounds}. This wight spawn is under the command of the wight that killed it. It doesn't have Drain Life or Wight Spawn and becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.i3OJZU2nk64Df3xm]{Clumsy 2} for as long as it is a wight spawn. If the creator of the wight spawn dies, the wight spawn becomes a full-fledged, autonomous wight; it regains its free will, gains Drain Life and Wight Spawn, and is no longer clumsy.</p>
