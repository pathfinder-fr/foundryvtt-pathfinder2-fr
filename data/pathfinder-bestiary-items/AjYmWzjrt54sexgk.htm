<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The quelaunt feeds on the emotional unrest of a single creature within 30 feet that's under a harmful emotion effect. The target must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:37|traits:damaging-effect] save or take [[/r {4d10}[mental]]]{4d10 mental damage} and be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned} for 1 round. If the target fails its saving throw, the quelaunt regains the same number of Hit Points and Feed on Emotion does not cost the quelaunt an action, allowing it to use another action this turn.</p>
