------ Description (en) ------
<p>A demilich long ago absorbed the spells from a staff into gemstone nodules embedded in its skull, with larger nodules representing higher-level spells. It can cast any of the spells as though it were Activating the staff, and regains 1 charge per 4 hours spent in torpor, to a maximum of 8 charges. A typical demilich has the spells from a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Ab5EjJyoRSec5YrW]{Greater Staff of Necromancy}</em>, but it could have spells from another staff of 8th level or lower instead.</p>
