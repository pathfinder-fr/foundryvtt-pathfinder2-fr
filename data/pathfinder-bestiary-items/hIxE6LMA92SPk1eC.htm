------ Description (en) ------
<p>When the caligni creeper dies, their body combusts in a flash of bright light.</p>
<p>All creatures in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10] must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:17] save <span data-visibility="gm">or be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} for [[/br 1d6 #rounds]]{1d6 rounds}</span>.</p>
<div data-visibility="gm">
<p>Creatures with @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.I0HYG0ctCLP5JRsW]{Light Blindness} who successfully save are still blinded for 1 round.</p>
<p>The creeper's gear and treasure are left in a pile where they died. As this isn't a magical effect, the light has no effect within magical darkness.</p>
</div>
