<p>An astradaemon draws power from the souls of the recently slain. If a Small or larger living creature dies within its aura, the astradaemon gains 5 temporary Hit Points and a status bonus to attack and damage rolls for 1 round, unless the creature was slain by an astradaemon's Devour Soul ability.</p>
<p>Incorporeal undead and living spirits traveling outside the body take [[/r {1d8}[force]]]{1d8 force damage} each round within the daemon's aura from the spiritual pressure as the astradaemon pulls in fragments of their soul.</p>
