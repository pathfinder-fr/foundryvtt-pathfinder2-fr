------ Description (en) ------
<p>The cloaker lets out an infrasonic moan that has one of the effects below. A creature that succeeds at a Will save is unaffected. Any creature that attempts this save becomes temporarily immune for 1 hour. Because the moan is infrasonic, most humanoids don't detect the source of their plight if they aren't already aware of the cloaker.</p>
