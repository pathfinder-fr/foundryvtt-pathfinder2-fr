------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a phoenix dies, it collapses into a pile of smoldering ashes before returning to life fully healed [[/br 1d4 #Self-Resurrection]]{1d4 rounds} later, as if subject to a 7th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.kqhPt9344UkcGVYO]{Resurrect}</em> ritual. Self-resurrection happens only if there are some remains to resurrect; for instance, a phoenix killed by a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.r7ihOgKv19eJQnik]{Disintegrate}</em> spell can't use this ability. A phoenix whose remains rest within an area devoted to an evil deity by <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Dbd5W6G8U2vzWolN]{Consecrate}</em> can't self-resurrect until its remains are no longer in that area. A phoenix can self-resurrect only once per year.</p>
