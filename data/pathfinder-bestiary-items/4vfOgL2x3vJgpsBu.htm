------ Description (en) ------
<p>The leshy glides gently through the air, moving 5 feet toward the ground and up to 25 feet forward. As long as the leshy spends at least 1 action gliding each round, it remains in the air at the end of each turn. For the purpose of determining damage from falls, a leaf leshy always treats falls as if they were 20 feet shorter.</p>
