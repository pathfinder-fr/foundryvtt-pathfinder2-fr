------ Description (en) ------
<p>The fire giant imbues its blade with flames and makes a greatsword Strike with a -2 circumstance penalty against each creature in a @Template[type:line|distance:15|damaging:yes]{15-foot line}. It makes only one attack roll and compares the result to each creature's AC. This Strike deals an additional [[/r {1d6}[fire]]]{1d6 fire damage} and counts as one attack for the fire giant's multiple attack penalty.</p>
