<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Frequency</strong> Once per day</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The dragon permanently befouls 10 cubic feet of liquid within 90 feet. The liquid becomes undrinkable and unable to support water-breathing life.</p>
<p>This destroys liquid magic or alchemical items if they're of a lower level than the dragon (a creature can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:35] save to protect liquids in its possession). This doesn't affect liquids in a creature's body.</p>
