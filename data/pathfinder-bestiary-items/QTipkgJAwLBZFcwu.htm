------ Description (en) ------
<p>The flytrap attacks a single target with both its leaves. The flytrap makes one leaf Strike. On a success, the flytrap deals the damage from one leaf Strike plus an additional [[/r {1d8}]]{1d8 damage} for every leaf beyond the first. On a failure, the flytrap deals the damage from one leaf Strike, but it can't use Improved Grab. It deals no damage on a critical failure. This counts toward the flytrap's multiple attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number of leaves the flytrap has.</p>
