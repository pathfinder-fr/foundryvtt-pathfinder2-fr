<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature in the dragon's vortex uses a Swim action.</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The dragon creates a current of water, forcing the triggering creature to attempt a <span data-pf2-action="swim" data-pf2-dc="40" data-pf2-label="Vortex Pull DC" data-pf2-glyph="A" data-pf2-show-dc="gm">Athletics</span> check to Swim.
