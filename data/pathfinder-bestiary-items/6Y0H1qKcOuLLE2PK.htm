<hr />
<p>A shoggoth constantly voices syllables and mutterings that mortals were not meant to hear. A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:38] save or become confused for 1 round ([[/br 2d4 #rounds]]{2d4 rounds} on a critical failure). A creature that successfully saves is temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>
