------ Description (en) ------
<p>A naiad bonds to a spring, pool, pond, or similar-sized water feature. While within 300 feet of her bonded body of water, she can use her innate <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.iAnpxrLaBU4V6Sej]{Tidal Surge}</em> at will. She doesn't recover Hit Points or reduce the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained} condition when resting beyond that range. Unlike most other nymphs, she doesn't suffer penalties from being apart from her bonded body of water. A naiad can perform a 24-hour ritual to bond herself to a new body of water.</p>
