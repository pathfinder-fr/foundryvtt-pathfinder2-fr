<p>The shining child sheds bright light. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:29] save. If it fails, it is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} for 1 minute, and if it critically fails, it's permanently blinded. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>
