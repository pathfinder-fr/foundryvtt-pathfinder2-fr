------ Description (en) ------
<p>The banshee unleashes a soul-chilling <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.FEsuyf203wTNE2et]{Wail of the Banshee}</em> (@Check[type:fortitude|dc:38] save). This Wail overcomes <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gIdDLrbswTV3OBJy]{Silence}</em> and similar effects of 5th level or lower. The banshee can instead use Wail as a three-action activity to overcome such effects of up to 8th level.</p>
<p>The banshee's Wail resonates for 1 round, and any creature that comes within the area during that time must attempt a save against the effect. A creature can't be affected more than once by the same Wail.</p>
<p data-visibility="gm">The banshee can't Wail again for [[/br 1d4 #Recharge Wail]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>
