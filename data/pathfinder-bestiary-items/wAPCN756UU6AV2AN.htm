------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a shield archon uses its <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.VlNcjmYyu95vOUe8]{Dimension Door}</em> innate spell, it can choose to move into the space of a willing ally it can see within range. If it does so, the ally switches places with the archon, appearing in the space the archon just vacated, as if it too had cast Dimension Door.</p>
