------ Description (en) ------
<p>The skulltaker causes splintered bones to erupt from all solid surfaces in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:100], except for surfaces of worked stone. A creature moving through the bones takes [[/r {10}[piercing]+{10}[negative]]]{10 piercing damage and 10 negative damage} for every 5 feet of movement. The first time each round a creature takes piercing damage from these splintered bones, it must succeed at a @Check[type:reflex|dc:40] save or take a -10-foot circumstance penalty to all Speeds for 10 minutes, or a -15-foot circumstance penalty for 24 hours on a critical failure. The bones remain in place until the skulltaker uses this action again or the bones are manually removed, which takes 10 minutes for each 5-foot square.</p>
