<hr />
<p>A creature entering the aura must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:20] save or be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} (plus @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} for the same duration on a critical failure). On a success, the creature is temporarily immune to the sickened and slowed effects of this stench for 1 hour. Regardless of the save, while within the aura, creatures take a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against diseases. An otyugh's stench is due to the oflal and refuse that it wallows in, so cleaning the creature thoroughly (with <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.WzLKjSw6hsBhuklC]{Create Water}</em> and sufficient scrubbing, for example) deactivates the aura, while a sufficiently plugged nose allows an individual to avoid exposure to the stench.</p>
