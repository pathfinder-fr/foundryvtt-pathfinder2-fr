<p>A ghaele attempts to Recall Knowledge about a foe it is facing. If successful, it can change the elemental damage dealt by its greatsword and light ray to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic, usually to match the a foe's weakness. It can also change its energy resistance to any of these energy types (this can be a different type than for its attacks). The choices remain until it next uses Choose Weakness.</p>
