------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a gourd leshy dies, a burst of primal energy explodes from its body, restoring [[/r {1d8}[healing]]]{1d8 Hit Points} to each plant creature in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]. This area is filled with gourds, becoming difficult terrain. If the terrain is not a viable environment for these gourds, they wither after 24 hours.</p>
