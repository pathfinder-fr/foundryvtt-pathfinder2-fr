------ Description (en) ------
<p>A dryad is mystically bonded to a single great tree and must remain within 300 feet of it. If she moves beyond that range, she becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} and is unable to recover. She must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:18] save every hour or increase the sickened value by 1 (to a maximum of sickened 4). After 24 hours, she becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1}, with this value increasing by 1 every additional 24 hours. A dryad can perform a 24-hour ritual to bond herself to a new tree.</p>
