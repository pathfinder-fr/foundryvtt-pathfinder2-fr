------ Description (en) ------
<p>Nine lantern archons can use this activity, all within 1 round of the first, to merge together to form a composite being for 7 rounds that appears as a glowing warrior of light.</p>
<p>The @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.gztjujplfVCBVXv0]{Gestalt} has the base statistics of a legion archon (AC, saving throws, attacks, skills, Speeds, and so on) but the spells and special abilities of a lantern archon. Additionally, it has a ranged light ray Strike ([[/r 1d20+18 #Light Ray]]{Light Ray +18}, Damage [[/r {3d4}[fire] + {3d4}[good] # Light Ray]]{3d4 fire and 3d4 good}), and the bonus from its Lantern of Hope increases to +3.</p>
<p>When the gestalt separates, its remaining Hit Points are divided evenly among the lantern archons, and if the gestalt had fewer than 9 HP, some of the lantern archons die.</p>
