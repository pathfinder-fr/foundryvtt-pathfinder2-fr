------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a balor dies, their body explodes in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:100]{100-Foot Aura} of intense demonic flame. All creatures and objects in range take [[/r {16d10}[fire]]]{16d10 fire damage} (@Check[type:reflex|dc:45|basic:true] save). Because the flame is infused with Abyssal energy, creatures in the area apply only half their usual fire resistance. Creatures with immunity to fire use an outcome one degree of success better than what they rolled, instead of gaining the usual benefit of immunity. The bodies of creatures reduced to 0 Hit Points by a balor's death throes are completely incinerated into fine ash.</p>
