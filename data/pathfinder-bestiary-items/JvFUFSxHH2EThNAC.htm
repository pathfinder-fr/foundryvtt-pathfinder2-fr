------ Description (en) ------
<p>The tor linnorm expels a @Template[type:cone|distance:60] of flame and ash dealing [[/r {20d6}[fire]]]{20d6 fire damage} to creatures within the area (@Check[type:reflex|dc:46|basic:true] save). At the start of the tor linnorm's next turn, the area affected by the breath weapon is covered in thick, scorching smoke that burns both the lungs and eyes, dealing an additional [[/r {10d6}[fire]]]{10d6 fire damage} to all creatures in the area (@Check[type:reflex|dc:46|basic:true] save). A creature that spends an entire round in the smoke with open eyes must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:44] save or is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} for 1 minute. The smoke dissipates after 1 minute; in strong winds, the smoke dissipates in 5 rounds, and in more powerful winds, it may clear even more quickly.</p>
<p data-visibility="gm">The tor linnorm can't use Breath Weapon again for [[/br 1d4 #Recharge Breath Weapon]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>
