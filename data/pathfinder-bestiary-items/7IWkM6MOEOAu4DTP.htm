------ Description (en) ------
<p>The hamadryad touches a tree within her domain of enough volume to contain her and merges into it for as long as she wishes. She can Cast a Spell while inside as long as the spell doesn't require a line of effect outside the tree. She can hear, but not see, what's going on outside the tree. She can enter or exit her extradimensional domain from any tree in her domain. She can Dismiss this effect.</p>
<p>Significant physical damage dealt to the tree expels the hamadryad from the tree and deals [[/r {3d6}]]{3d6 damage} to her. <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.115Xp9E38CJENhNS]{Passwall}</em> expels the hamadryad without dealing damage.</p>
<p>The hamadryad can also touch a tree within her domain to instead enter her extradimensional domain; Tree Meld gains the extradimensional trait. A hamadryad can bring up to eight other creatures with her when entering her home. The hamadryad can still be expelled from this space as above.</p>
