------ Description (en) ------
<p>Lemures have little drive of their own, but other devils can take command of them. A non-lemure devil can issue a command to all lemures within 60 feet of it with a single action, which has the auditory and concentrate traits. The devil picks one of the following orders lemures can understand, and the lemures follow that order. The command and its effects end once the commander is out of the lemure's sight, a new command is issued by the same or another devil, or the lemure dies.</p>
