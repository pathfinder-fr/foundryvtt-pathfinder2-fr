------ Description (en) ------
<p>A zombie hulk can throw corpses at foes. While any Medium dead body will do, they sometimes throw @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.0plBflWwrCWQO2RO]{Zombie Shamblers}, who take just as much damage from being thrown as the target they hit. A thrown shambler lands @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone}, but if it's not destroyed, it can rise and use other actions normally.</p>
