------ Description (en) ------
<p>If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights.</p>
<p>If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a @Check[type:will|dc:22|name:Escape Thralldom] saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.</p>
