------ Description (en) ------
<p>Any weapon a balor wields becomes a <em>+3 @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.woxl2FrrgAcJDu0t]{Major Striking } @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.6xaxxKfvXED6LfIY]{Vorpal} weapon</em> made of cold iron and silver while the demon holds it. A weapon that isn't eligible for the vorpal rune doesn't gain its effects. The balor can change its evil damage to chaotic whenever it attacks. The demon can conjure a whip made of flames with an Interact action. This whip gains the same benefits as other weapons the balor wields.</p>
