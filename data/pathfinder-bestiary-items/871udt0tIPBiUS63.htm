------ Description (en) ------
<p>Treerazer exudes a pulse of sickly green light in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]. All plants in the area (including creatures under the effect of his aura of corruption) blacken and wither. Non-creature plants immediately wither and die. Plant creatures take [[/r {20d8}[negative]]]{20d8 negative damage} with a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:49|basic:true] save. A creature that fails its save is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed 1} for 1 minute and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 3}. Treerazer can choose to exclude any number of plants in the area from this effect, and generally does so to preserve twisted and corrupted plants or fungi, or plant creatures that are allied to his cause.</p>
<p data-visibility="gm">Treerazer can't use Defoliation for [[/br 1d4 #Recharge Defoliation]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>
