Name: Effect: Moderate Flames Curse
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Smoke and flickering visions of flame fill your senses more completely, and harmless flickers of obscuring flames also fill your space.</p>
<p>You are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} from other creatures, though as the other creatures aren't cursed themselves, they can benefit from effects that would allow them to ignore or mitigate the concealed condition, as normal. All other creatures and objects are concealed from you regardless of distance; however, when casting a fire spell, you automatically succeed at the flat check for this concealed condition for targets within 30 feet.</p>
<p>All your senses become imprecise beyond 30 feet, meaning everything past 30 feet that you'd normally be able to see is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} from you.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Note: You need to apply the effects of this curse manually.</em></p>
