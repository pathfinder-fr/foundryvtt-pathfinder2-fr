Name: Effect: Major Lore Curse
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>The massive flow of information clouding your mind overwhelms your ability to communicate with others. You can understand all languages, but you can't speak, use linguistic effects, or otherwise communicate with your allies.</p>
<p>You take a -4 penalty to initiative, as trying to process a surge of information about what's happening around you slows your ability to respond to it.</p>
<p>The attention you divert to process this huge influx of information means you are always @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed}.</p>
<p>At the start of each of your turns, you automatically make one check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.KygTSeDvsFoSO6HW]{Recall Knowledge} as a free action. This uses a skill of your choice that has the Recall Knowledge action, using a result equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus in that skill (with no other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers).</p>
<p>If you Cast a Spell with a verbal component, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the spell is lost.</p>
<p>You gain a +4 status bonus on saving throws against linguistic effects.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Note: The bonus to saving throws and penalty to initiative rolls are applied automatically. You need to apply the remaining effects manually.</em></p>
