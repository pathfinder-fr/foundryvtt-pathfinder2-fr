------ Description (en) ------
<p>The flow of information through your mind grows.</p>
<p>You take a -4 penalty to initiative, as trying to process a surge of information about what's happening around you slows your ability to respond to it.</p>
<p>The attention you divert to process this huge influx of information means you are always @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed}.</p>
<p>At the start of each of your turns, you automatically make one check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.KygTSeDvsFoSO6HW]{Recall Knowledge} as a free action. This uses a skill of your choice that has the Recall Knowledge action, using a result equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus in that skill (with no other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers).</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Note: The penalty to initiative rolls is applied automatically. You need to apply the remaining effects manually.</em></p>
