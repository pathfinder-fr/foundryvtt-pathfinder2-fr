------ Description (en) ------
<p>You stand just steps from the grave.</p>
<p>Non-magical effects that would restore your Hit Points only grant you half as many HP as normal.</p>
<p>You become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1}, and this drained condition is cumulative with any other drained conditions you gain. This drained condition is removed only when you Refocus; effects that normally remove the drained condition reduce your drained condition to drained 1 instead.</p>
<p>You become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Yl48xTdMh3aeQYL2]{Wounded 1}. This wounded condition is removed only when you Refocus; effects that normally remove the wounded condition reduce your wounded condition to wounded 1 instead.</p>
<p>In addition, you gain resistance to poison equal to half your level.</p>
<p>You gain a +4 status bonus to saves against diseases, poisons, and death effects, and if you roll a success on such a save, you get a critical success instead. If you roll a critical failure on a save against a disease, poison, or death effect, you get a failure instead.</p>
<p>When you would attempt a recovery check, you can choose to get an automatic success instead of rolling.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Note: The bonus to saving throws is applied automatically. You need to apply the remaining effects manually.</em></p>
