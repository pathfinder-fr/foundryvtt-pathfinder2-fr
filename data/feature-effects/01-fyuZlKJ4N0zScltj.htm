------ Description (en) ------
<p>An aura of a whirling storm whips up in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10] around you and in your space. The aura puts out small non-magical fires 1 round after they're lit or brought into your aura. The whirling winds impose a -2 circumstance penalty on ranged attack rolls using physical ammunition that target you or originate from you.</p>
<p>Electrical energy builds up within your storm, turning you into a lightning rod; you gain weakness 5 (or half your level, whichever is greater) to electricity, but torrential rain grants you an equal amount of fire resistance. Electricity spells or effects that have additional effects for a creature wearing or holding metal treat you as though you were wearing metal.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Note: The penalty to ranged attack rolls that you make is applied automatically. You need to apply the remaining effects manually.</em></p>
