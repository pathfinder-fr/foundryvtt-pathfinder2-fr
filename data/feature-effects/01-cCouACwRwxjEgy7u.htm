<p>As your body rises, you float just above the ground beneath you.</p>
<p>You become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled 4}, and take a -4 penalty to saves and DCs against @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.PMbdMWc2QroouFGD]{Grapple}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.7blmbDrQFNfdT731]{Shove}, and other forms of forced movement.</p>
<p>You are treated as one size smaller for wind effects. You gain a +2 status bonus against @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.ge56Lu1xXVFYUnLP]{Trip} attempts, you only take half as much damage from falls, and you gain the effects of the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.HJYQlmGTdtyGWr6a]{Powerful Leap} and @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ZBhvJ9O8MvBFAlhq]{Quick Jump} skill feats.

<p>You can walk on liquids as if they were solid; you gain the effects of the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.TVFfTP9fHRidwBlW]{Cloud Jump} skill feat; and you don't leave tracks, trigger weight-sensitive pressure plates, or otherwise connect with the ground below you.</p>
