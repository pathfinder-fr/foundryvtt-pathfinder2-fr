------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You conjure a temporary simple tool, such as a shovel or rope into your hands. It lasts until it is used for a single activity or for 1 minute, whichever comes first, after which it disappears. The tool is obviously temporarily conjured, and thus can’t be sold or passed off as a genuine item.&nbsp;</span></p>
