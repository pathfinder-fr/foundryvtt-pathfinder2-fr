Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You request a direct intercession from the natural world. Nature always refuses unnatural requests and might grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its character) than the one you asked for. A <em>primal phenomenon</em> spell can do any of the following things. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Duplicate any primal spell of 9th level or lower.</li>
<li>Duplicate any non-primal spell of 7th level or lower.</li>
<li>Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.</li>
<li>Reverse certain effects that refer to the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=377"><em>wish</em></a> spell.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;At the GM's discretion, you can try to use <em>primal phenomenon</em> to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.&nbsp;</p>
