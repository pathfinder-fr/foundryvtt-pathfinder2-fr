------ Description (en) ------
<p>You forge a connection of life energy between you and your<br>target, distributing harm between both of you. When you first @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast the Spell}, the target recovers [[/r 1d4]] Hit Points. The first time each round that the target takes damage, reduce the damage it takes by 3 (to a minimum of 0 damage). You lose 3 Hit Points each time, or the total damage dealt, if less than 3; this damage ignores any immunities or resistances you have and can't otherwise be mitigated in any way.</p>
<p>The spell ends immediately if you fall @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}. You can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.AjLSHZSWQ90exdLo]{Dismiss} the spell.</p>
