------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your hand glows with impossible colors from beyond the stars, and your touch saps both color and vitality from the living. The target must attempt a Fortitude save; creatures with the gnome trait take a -2 circumstance penalty to this save.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong>: The target is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong>: The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled} 2 for 1 round.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong>: The target is Enfeebled 2 for 1 minute and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained} 1. The target is also filled with listlessness and ennui. For 1 round, if the target tries to use a move action, it must succeed at a Will save against your spell DC or the action is lost; this effect has the mental and emotion traits.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature is permanently Enfeebled 2 and Drained 2 (although magic such as @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.SnaLVgxZ9ryUFmUr]{Restoration} can reduce or remove these conditions).</p>
