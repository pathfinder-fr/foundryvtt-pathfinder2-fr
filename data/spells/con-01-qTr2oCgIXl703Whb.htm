------ Description (en) ------
<p>You teleport one object of light or negligible Bulk held in your hand to the target. The object appears instantly in the target's hand, if they have a free hand, or at their feet if they don't. The target knows what object you are attempting to send them. If the target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} or refuses to accept your gift, or if the spell would teleport a creature (even if the creature is inside an extradimensional container), the spell fails.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> The spell's range increases to 500 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> As 3rd level, and the object's maximum Bulk increases to 1. You can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast the Spell} with 3 actions instead of 1; doing so increases the range to 1 mile and you don't need line of sight to the target, but you must be extremely familiar with the target.</p>
