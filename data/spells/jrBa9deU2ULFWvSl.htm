------ Description (en) ------
<p>You call down four meteors that explode in a fiery blast. Each meteor deals 6d10 bludgeoning damage to any creatures in the 10-foot burst at the center of its area of effect before exploding, dealing 14d6 fire damage to any creatures in its 40-foot burst. The meteors' central 10-foot bursts can't overlap, and a creature takes the same amount of fire damage no matter how many overlapping explosions it's caught in. The saving throw applies to both the bludgeoning and the fire damage.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d10, and the fire damage increases by 2d6.</p>
