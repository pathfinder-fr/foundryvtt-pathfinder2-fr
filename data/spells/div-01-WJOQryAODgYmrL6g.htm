------ Description (en) ------
<p>You project psychic vibrations onto the target object, imprinting it with a short message or emotional theme of your design. This imprinted sensation is revealed to a creature who casts @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.5LYi9Efs6cko4GGL]{Object Reading} (page 222) on the target object, replacing any emotional events the item was present for. If the object is in the area of a @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.rsZ5c0AUyywe5yoK]{Retrocognition} spell, the imprinted messages appear as major events in the timeline, but they don't interfere with any other visions.</p>
<p>If the object is targeted with @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.OhD2Z6rIGGD5ocZA]{Read Aura} of a higher spell level than <em>imprint message</em>, the caster learns that the object has been magically modified. When you @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast this Spell}, any prior vibrations placed on an object by previous castings of <em>imprint message</em> fade.</p>
