------ Description (en) ------
<p>You unleash a holy beam of freezing moonlight. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals 5d6 cold damage; if the target is a fiend or undead, you deal an extra [[/r {5d6}[good]]]{5d6 good damage}.</p>
<p>Moonlight ray's cold damage is silver damage for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target takes double cold damage, as well as double good damage if a fiend or undead.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target takes full damage. If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, moonlight ray attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The cold damage increases by 2d6, and the good damage against fiends and undead increases by [[/r 2d6[good]]]{2d6 good damage}.</p>
