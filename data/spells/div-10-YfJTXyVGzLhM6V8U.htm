------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You request aid directly from your divine source. Your divine source always refuses a request out of line with its nature, and it might grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its nature) than the one you asked for. A casting of <em>miracle</em> can do any of the following things. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Duplicate any divine spell of 9th level or lower.</li>
<li>Duplicate any non-divine spell of 7th level or lower.</li>
<li>Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.</li>
<li>Reverse certain effects that refer to the <em>wish</em> spell.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;The GM might allow you to try using <em>miracle</em> to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.&nbsp;</p>
