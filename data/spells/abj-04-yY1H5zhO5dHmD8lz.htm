------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">A divine beacon radiates serenity, soothing nearby allies. Allies within the area gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=60">emotion</a> effects. An ally can touch the font as an Interact action; if they do so, the spell attempts to counteract one emotion effect affecting the ally of the ally’s choice, after which that emotion effect is temporarily immune for 1 day. If the spell succeeds at the counteract check, it removes the emotion effect from your ally, though not from any other creatures the effect might be affecting.</span></p>
