------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You channel the might of dragons into your voice, letting out a roar that engenders respect in dragonkind but that instills fear in most other creatures. The impressive roar grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks for 10 minutes against dragons that were in the area at the time of casting. All enemies within the area other than dragons must attempt a Will save; to these enemies, <em>roar of the wyrm</em> is a fear effect.<br /><br /><em>Roar of the wyrm</em> affects non-dragon creatures with deep ties to dragonkind (such as a barbarian with the draconic instinct, a sorcerer with the draconic bloodline, or a member of a culture that reveres dragons) as if they had the dragon trait. The GM decides if a creature is aligned enough with dragonkind to be affected in this way.<br /><br /><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.<br /><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened} 1.<br /><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened} 2.<br /><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened} 3 and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} for 1 round.&nbsp;</span></p>
