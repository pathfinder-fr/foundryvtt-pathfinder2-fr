While within the area, you can make nature's wrath Strikes by commanding plants, wind, rocks, and other natural features to attack enemies. These are melee Strikes that use your spell attack modifier, can target any creature within the ward, and deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage equal to [[/r 2d8]] plus your spellcasting ability modifier. </span></p>
