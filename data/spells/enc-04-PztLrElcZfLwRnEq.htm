Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>The target becomes distracted and suggestible, inundated by vivid daydreams.</p><p>
<hr><b>Critical Success</b>  The target is unaffected.</p><p>
<b>Success</b>  The target's attention wavers. It becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.AdPVz7rbaVSRxHFg]{Fascinated} by its daydreams.</p><p>
<b>Failure</b>  As success, except that you appear in the dream and give a suggestion. This can be to approach you, run away (as if it had the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition), Release what it's holding, Drop @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone}, or stand in place. The creature follows this course of action as its first action after you Cast the Spell.</p><p>
<b>Critical Failure</b>  As failure, but the target follows the course of action for as many actions as possible for the spell's duration, and it does nothing else.</p>
