------ Description (en) ------
<p>The target becomes distracted and suggestible, inundated by vivid daydreams.</p><p>
<hr><b>Critical Success</b>  The target is unaffected.</p><p>
<b>Success</b>  The target's attention wavers. It becomes @JournalEntry[Flat-Footed] and @JournalEntry[Fascinated] by its daydreams.</p><p>
<b>Failure</b>  As success, except that you appear in the dream and give a suggestion. This can be to approach you, run away (as if it had the @JournalEntry[Fleeing] condition), Release what it's holding, Drop @JournalEntry[Prone], or stand in place. The creature follows this course of action as its first action after you Cast the Spell.</p><p>
<b>Critical Failure</b>  As failure, but the target follows the course of action for as many actions as possible for the spell's duration, and it does nothing else.</p>
