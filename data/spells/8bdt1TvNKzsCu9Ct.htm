------ Description (en) ------
<p>With touches to the targets’ foreheads, you bring them into mental communion. The targets can share thoughts and experiences, but not words. When one target attempts to&nbsp; Recall Knowledge, the other can&nbsp; Aid the first target’s skill check, using any&nbsp; Lore skill (even if that Lore wouldn’t normally apply) without having made any preparations to Aid.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong>&nbsp;You can touch one additional target t include them in the spell’s effects. Multiple targets can attempt checks to Aid the target who is attempting to Recall Knowledge.</p>
