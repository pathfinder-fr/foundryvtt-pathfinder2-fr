------ Description (en) ------
<p>You call upon your muse to greatly increase the benefits you provide to your allies with your @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.IAjvwqgiDr3qGYxY]{Inspire Courage} or @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.bH0kPuf7UKxRvi2P]{Inspire Defense} composition.

The DC is usually a very hard DC of a level equal to that of the highest-level target of your composition, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect of your inspire courage or inspire defense composition depends on the result of your check.</p>
