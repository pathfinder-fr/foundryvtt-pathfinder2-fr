------ Description (en) ------
<p>You transform into the shape of a legendary monster, assuming a Huge battle form. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. When you cast this spell, choose phoenix, purple worm, or sea serpent. While in this form, you gain the beast trait (for phoenix) or the animal trait (for purple worm or sea serpent). You can Dismiss the spell.</p>
<p>You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:</p>
<ul>

Your attack modifier is +28, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled} condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.</li>
