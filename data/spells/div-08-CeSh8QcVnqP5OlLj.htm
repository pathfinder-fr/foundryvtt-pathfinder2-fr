Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>You learn the name of the target's exact location (including the building, community, and country) and plane of existence. You can target a creature only if you've seen it in person, have one of its significant belongings, or have a piece of its body. To target an object, you must have touched it or have a fragment of it. Discern location automatically overcomes protections against detection and divination of lower level than this spell, even if they would normally have a chance to block it.</p>
