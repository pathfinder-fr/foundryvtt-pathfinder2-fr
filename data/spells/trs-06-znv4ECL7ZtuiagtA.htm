------ Description (en) ------
<p>You try to turn the target's flesh into stone. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is @JournalEntry[Slowed] 1 for 1 round.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is @JournalEntry[Slowed] 1 and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the @JournalEntry[Slowed] condition increases by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the @JournalEntry[Slowed] condition by 1. When a creature is unable to act due to the @JournalEntry[Slowed] condition from flesh to stone, the creature is @JournalEntry[Petrified] permanently. The spell ends if the creature is @JournalEntry[Petrified] or the @JournalEntry[Slowed] condition is removed.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target is initially @JournalEntry[Slowed] 2.</p>
