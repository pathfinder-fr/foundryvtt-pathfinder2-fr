<p>Your shadow wriggles before spreading out from you, forming a gateway of clinging, consuming shadow through which the horrors of another plane can barely be seen. The first time each turn you @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.3f5DMFu8fPiqHpRg]{Sustain the Spell}, the radius increases by 5 feet. Each enemy that enters the area or begins its turn in the area takes [[/r 2d6 #negative]] negative damage and must attempt a Reflex save.</p>

<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature sinks partially into the shadow, taking half damage and a –5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for as long it remains in the area.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but the creature takes full damage and a 10-foot circumstance penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is absorbed into the shadows, where it can be seen below the surface; it takes double damage and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} for 1 round or until it @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escapes}.</p>
