------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You envelop the target in a shroud of shadow. The target perceives light as one step lower than it actually is (<a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=407">bright light</a> becomes <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=408">dim light</a>, for example), affecting their ability to sense creatures and objects accordingly. The shroud also provides the target a +1 status bonus to saving throws against light effects. While this effect is helpful to creatures sensitive to light, if the creature is unwilling, it can attempt a Reflex save to avoid the shroud and reduce the effect.<br><br><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.<br><strong>Success</strong> The effect lasts for 1 round<br><strong>Failure</strong> The effect lasts its normal duration.&nbsp;</span></p>
