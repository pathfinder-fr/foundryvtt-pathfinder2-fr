------ Description (en) ------
<p>Each creature in the area becomes drowsy and might fall asleep. A creature that falls @JournalEntry[Unconscious] from this spell doesn't fall @JournalEntry[Prone] or release what it's holding. This spell doesn't prevent creatures from waking up due to a successful Perception check, limiting its utility in combat.</p><p>
<hr><b>Critical Success</b>  The creature is unaffected.</p><p>
<b>Success</b>  The creature takes a –1 status penalty to Perception checks for 1 round.</p><p>
<b>Failure</b>  The creature falls @JournalEntry[Unconscious]. If it's still @JournalEntry[Unconscious] after 1 minute, it wakes up automatically.</p><p>
<b>Critical Failure</b>  The creature falls @JournalEntry[Unconscious]. If it's still @JournalEntry[Unconscious] after 1 hour, it wakes up automatically.</p><p>
<hr><b>Heightened (4th)</b>  The creatures fall @JournalEntry[Unconscious] for 1 round on a failure or 1 minute on a critical failure. They fall @JournalEntry[Prone] and release what they're holding, and they can't attempt Perception checks to wake up. When the duration ends, the creature is sleeping normally instead of automatically waking up.</p>
