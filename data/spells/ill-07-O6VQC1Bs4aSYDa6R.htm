Name: Mask of Terror
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>The target appears to be a gruesome and terrifying creature. The effect is unique to each observer, so a human viewing the target might see a demon with bloody fangs, but a demon observing the target might see a glowing angelic visage. When any creature attempts a hostile action against the target, the creature must attempt a Will save. It is then temporarily immune until the end of its next turn.</p><p>
<hr><b>Success</b>  The creature is unaffected.</p><p>
<b>Failure</b>  The creature becomes @JournalEntry[Frightened] 2 before using its action.</p><p>
<b>Critical Failure</b>  The creature becomes @JournalEntry[Frightened] 2, and its action fails and is wasted.</p><p>
<hr><b>Heightened (8th)</b>  You can target up to 5 creatures. If a creature uses a hostile action or reaction that affects multiple targets simultaneously, it needs to attempt only one save against mask of terror.</p>
