<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">The flow of time congeals around an object or creature, holding it in place. The target must attempt a Will save (an unattended object automatically critically fails its save).<br><br><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.<br><strong>Success</strong> The target is <a class="entity-link" data-pack="pf2e.conditionspf2e" data-id="dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix" draggable="true"><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> Stunned</a> 1 as time thickens around it.<br><strong>Failure</strong> Time ceases to pass for the target for 1 round. It is invulnerable to all damage, it cannot be targeted or affected by anything, and no rounds elapse for any timed durations, conditions, afflictions, and other effects it has. While in <em>stasis</em>, the target can’t be moved, and it remains fixed in place, defying gravity if need be.<br><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target is held in stasis for 3 rounds. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt a Will save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round or end it entirely on a critical success.&nbsp;</span></p>
