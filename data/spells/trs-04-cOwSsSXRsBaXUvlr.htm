------ Description (en) ------
<p>The flow of time congeals around an object or creature, holding it in place. The target must attempt a Will save (an unattended object automatically critically fails its save).</p>
<hr />
<p><span><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Success</strong> The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned} 1 as time thickens around it.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Failure</strong> Time ceases to pass for the target for 1 round. It is invulnerable to all damage, it cannot be targeted or affected by anything, and no rounds elapse for any timed durations, conditions, afflictions, and other effects it has. While in <em>stasis</em>, the target can't be moved, and it remains fixed in place, defying gravity if need be.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target is held in stasis for 3 rounds. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt a Will save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round or end it entirely on a critical success. </span></p>
