------ Description (en) ------
<p><span>A large gem floats around the target in an erratic pattern. The gem has 5 Hit Points. Each time a creature Strikes the target, the target attempts a DC 11 flat check. On a success, the gem blocks the attack, so the attack first damages the gem and then applies any remaining damage to the target. If the gem is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it shatters, immediately dealing the creature that destroyed it 1d8 slashing damage (basic Reflex save), as long as that creature is within 10 feet of the target.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The gem has 5 additional HP, and the damage dealt by its detonation increases by 1d8.</p>
