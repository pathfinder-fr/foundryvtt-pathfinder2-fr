<p>You transform into a Tiny animal that commonly serves as a spellcaster's familiar. You gain the effects of the spell pest form, heightened to the level of familiar form you cast. However, you can transform into only a bat, cat, raven, snake, or other Tiny animal of a type that you have seen serve as a spellcaster's familiar.</p>
