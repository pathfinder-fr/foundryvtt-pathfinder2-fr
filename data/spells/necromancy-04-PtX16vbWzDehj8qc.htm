------ Description (en) ------
<p>You create an echo of a powerful poltergeist, temporarily anchoring it to the area to terrorize and harm any opponents foolish enough to remain in the area. Because the poltergeist is a manifestation and is not truly present, it can't be attacked or hurt; it remains @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible} unless otherwise stated. When you Cast the Spell, and the first time you Sustain it on subsequent rounds, the poltergeist creates your choice of one of the following effects.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deathly Assault</strong> (negative) The poltergeist focuses on one creature in the area and flies through that creature's space, dealing [[/r 4d10 #negative]]{4d10 negative damage} (basic Fortitude save).</li>
<li><strong>Frighten</strong> (emotion, fear, mental) The poltergeist becomes visible, appearing as a skeletal, ghostlike humanoid. Creatures in the area must attempt a <span data-pf2-check="will" data-pf2-traits="emotion,fear,mental,necromancy" data-pf2-label="Frighten DC" data-pf2-show-dc="gm">Will</span> save, becoming @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2} on a failure.</li>
<li><strong>Telekinetic Storm</strong> (force) The poltergeist hurls debris and quasi-real objects around in the area. All creatures in the area take [[/r 4d8 #force]]{4d8 force damage} (<span data-pf2-check="reflex" data-pf2-traits="necromancy,damaging-effect" data-pf2-label="Telekinetic Storm DC" data-pf2-show-dc="gm">basic Reflex</span> save).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The damage of the deathly assault effect increases by [[/r 1d10]], and the damage of the telekinetic storm effect increases by [[/r 1d8]].</p>
