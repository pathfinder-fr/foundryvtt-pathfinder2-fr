<p><strong>Area</strong> 10-foot radius, 60-foot-tall cylinder</p>
<hr />
<p>You inundate the area with concentrated positive energy, which scours away the stain of undeath. Each creature in the area takes 6d8 positive damage and must attempt a basic Reflex save. Creatures that fail the save also take [[/r {1d8}[persistent,positive]]] @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Positive Damage}. Creatures that take persistent positive damage from scouring pulse are wreathed in a heatless halo of light. They emit bright light in a 5-foot radius preventing them from being @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed}; if the creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible}, they're concealed while affected by scouring pulse, rather than being undetected.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> The positive damage increases to 9d8 damage, and the persistent positive damage increases to [[/r {2d8}[persistent,positive]]] @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Positive Damage}. Creatures remain suffused in light for [[/r 1d4 #Rounds]]{1d4 additional rounds} after removing the persistent positive damage.</p>
