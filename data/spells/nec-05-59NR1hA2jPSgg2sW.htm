------ Description (en) ------
<p>You point at a target in range, and its skin grows searing blisters filled with caustic fluid. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target grows one blister. You can spend a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to pop a blister. The target and each creature in a 15-foot cone originating from the target takes <a class="inline-roll roll" data-mode="roll" data-flavor="acid" data-formula="7d6" title="acid"><i class="fas fa-dice-d20"></i> 7d6</a> acid damage (basic Fortitude save). You choose the direction of the cone, which can't include the target. When no blisters are left, the spell ends.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but the target grows two blisters.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As success, but the target grows four blisters.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage of a popped blister increases by <a class="inline-roll roll" data-mode="roll" data-flavor="acid" data-formula="1d6" title="acid"><i class="fas fa-dice-d20"></i> 1d6</a>.</p>
