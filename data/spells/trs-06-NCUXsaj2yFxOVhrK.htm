Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>You transform the target into a skinstitch, a hideous construct covered in the flesh of sentient humanoids.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target becomes a skinstitch. If it's at least 4 levels lower than you, you can make it a minion which gives it the minion trait. You can have a maximum of four minions under your control. If it doesn't become a minion, you can give it one simple command that it pursues single-mindedly. If you aren't a follower of @Compendium[pf2e.deities.GX6PF9ifR47Xyjg9]{Norgorber}, it ignores any of your subsequent commands. A follower of Norgorber can give the skinstitch simple commands by presenting a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.upzjwQ96cZG0Xlmx]{Religious Symbol} of the deity and commanding it with a single action that has the auditory and concentrate traits.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, except a skinstitch that doesn't become your minion stays in place and attacks anyone that attacks or tries to move it, rather than following your command.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to create the skinstitch.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You create the skinstitch, but it goes berserk and attempts to kill you, ignoring your commands even if you are a follower of Norgorber.</span></p>
