<p>You briefly conjure a kaiju, a massive, rampaging monster with a unique name and legendary reputation. It rises from its secluded lair to annihilate your foes. The summoned kaiju occupies the space of a Gargantuan creature. When you Cast this Spell, choose one of the kaiju below to summon.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agmazar the Star Titan</strong> Speed 100 feet, climb 50 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (necromancy, negative) <em>Channel Void</em> Each foe in a 100-foot emanation takes [[/r 16d8 #negative]]{16d8 negative energy damage} with a basic Fortitude save; <strong>Depart</strong> (transmutation) <em>Gravitic Repulsion</em> Each foe in a 50-foot emanation is pushed 100 feet away unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.</li>
<li><strong>Agyra, the Forever Storm</strong> Speed 80 feet, fly 200 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (electricity, evocation) <em>Breath of a Thousand Storms</em> Agyra shoots two 1,200-foot lines of electricity, one from each of her heads. The lines can't overlap. Each creature along one of the lines takes [[/r 6d12 #electricity]]{6d12 electricity damage} with a basic Reflex save. On a failure, the creature is also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} for 1 round (or for 1 minute on a critical failure); <strong>Depart</strong> (evocation, sonic) <em>Thunderous Blast</em> Each creature within a 100-foot emanation takes [[/r 6d10 #sonic]]{6d10 sonic damage} with a basic Reflex save, and is also knocked @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone} on a failed save.</li>
<li><strong>Bezravnis, the Inferno Below</strong> Speed 100 feet, burrow 100 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (earth, evocation) <em>Burrow from the Earth's Heart</em> Bezravnis explodes from the ground where it was summoned, causing all creatures in a 50-foot emanation to take [[/8 8d12 #bludgeoning]]{8d12 bludgeoning damage} with a basic Reflex save. This potentially collapses structures with the collapse effect of the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.x7SPrsRxGb2Vy2nu]{Earthquake} spell, except there is no chance of falling into a fissure; <strong>Depart</strong> <em>Web Hurricane</em> Bezravnis departs with a hurricane of webbing. All creatures within a 50-foot emanation must succeed at a Reflex save or take a -20-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it Escapes (or is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} until it escapes on a critical failure). The Escape DC is your spell DC.</li>
<li><strong>Mogaru, the Final King</strong> Speed 100 feet, swim 100 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (auditory, enchantment, mental) <em>Trance of the King's Melody</em> Mogaru manifests with a burst of the song that summoned him, requiring all foes within 60 feet who can hear him to attempt a Will save, leaving them @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 3} on a failure; <strong>Depart</strong> (evocation, fire) <em>Volcanic Breath</em> Mogaru unleashes his scorching breath in a 120-foot cone. Each creature in the area takes [[/r 10d6 #fire]]{10d6 fire damage} with a basic Reflex save. On a failure, it also takes [[/r 4d6 #persistent fire]] @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Fire Damage}.</li>
<li><strong>Vorgozen, the Shapeless Feeder</strong> Speed 50 feet, climb 50 feet, swim 100 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (necromancy) <em>Pollute Magic</em> Vorgozen's foul presence pollutes magic around her. Each of your enemies within a 60-foot emanation that are under the effects of a spell must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 2}. Any of your enemies that Casts a Spell within 60 feet of Vorgozen must attempt a Fortitude save with the same effects unless it's already sickened; <strong>Depart</strong> (acid, evocation) <em>Beam of Purest Vitriol</em> Each creature in a 1,200-foot line takes [[/r 10d6 #acid]]{10d6 acid damage} and [[/r 10d6 #bludgeoning]]{10d6 bludgeoning damage} with a basic Fortitude save.</li>
<li><strong>Yarthoon, the Moon Grub</strong> Speed 60 feet, burrow 100 feet, fly 100 feet, swim 100 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (cold, evocation) <em>Algid Beam Barrage</em> Yarthoon fires countless beams, targeting each of your enemies within 200 feet of it.
