------ Description (en) ------
<p>You create a pattern of lights that pulses with intensity. Creatures are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} while inside the pattern. In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it's inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saving throws.</p><p>
<hr><b>Success</b>  The creature is unaffected.</p><p>
<b>Failure</b>  The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} by the pattern. If it exits the pattern, it can attempt a new save to recover from the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} condition at the end of each of its turns, to a maximum duration of 1 minute.</p><p>
<b>Critical Failure</b>  The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} for 1 minute.</p>
