------ Description (en) ------
<p>You send a wave of nightmarish visions crashing over your targets, leaving them @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed} by fear. These visions inflict real wounds on vulnerable targets, dealing 6d12 mental damage. If you target a sleeping creature, it wakes up as it attempts the save but takes one degree of success worse than the result it rolled on its save.</p>

<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2} and takes half the mental damage.</p>
