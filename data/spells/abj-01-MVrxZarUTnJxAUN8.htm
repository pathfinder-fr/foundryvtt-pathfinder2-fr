------ Description (en) ------
<p>You use magical chains, vines, or other tethers to bind your target to you. The creature can still try to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escape} and it or others can break the tethers by attacking them (the tethers have AC 15 and 10 Hit Points). You must stay within 30 feet of the target while it is tethered; moving more than 30 feet away from your target ends the spell. The target must attempt a Reflex save.</p>
