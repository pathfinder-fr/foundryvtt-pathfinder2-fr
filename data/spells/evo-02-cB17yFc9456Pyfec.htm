------ Description (en) ------
<p>You belch forth a swarm of magical vermin. You evoke and shape the creatures from your own imagination, allowing you to change the appearance of the creatures (typically a mix of centipedes, roaches, wasps, and worms), but this doesn’t change the effect of the spell. The vermin swarm over anyone in the area, their bites and stings dealing [[/r 2d8 #piercing]] piercing damage (basic Reflex save). A creature that fails its saving throw also becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened} 1. Once the spell ends, the swarm disappears.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> Increase the damage by [[/r 1d8#piercing]].</p>
