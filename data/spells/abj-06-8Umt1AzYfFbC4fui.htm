------ Description (en) ------
<p>You cause any spells cast on the target to spill out their energy in harmful surges. The target must attempt a Will save.</p><p>
<hr><b>Critical Success</b>  The target is unaffected.</p><p>
<b>Success</b>  Whenever the target becomes affected by a spell with a duration, the target takes 2d12 persistent force damage. Each time it takes persistent force damage from spellwrack, it reduces the remaining duration of spells affecting it by 1 round. Only a successful Arcana check against your spell DC can help the target recover from the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Damage}; the curse and the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Damage} end after 1 minute.</p><p>
<b>Failure</b>  As success, but the curse and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Damage} do not end on their own.</p><p>
<b>Critical Failure</b>  As failure, but the persistent force damage is 4d12.</p>
