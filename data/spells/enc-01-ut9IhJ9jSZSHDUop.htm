Name: Charming Touch
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>You infuse your target with attraction, causing it to act friendlier toward you. The target attempts a Will save. It gains a +4 circumstance bonus to this save if you or your allies recently threatened or were hostile to it. You can Dismiss the spell. If you use hostile actions against the target, the spell ends. After the spell ends, the target doesn't necessarily realize it was charmed unless its friendship with you or the actions you convinced it to take clash with its expectations, which could potentially allow you to convince the target to continue being your friend via mundane means.</p><p>
<hr><b>Critical Success</b>  The target is unaffected and aware you tried to charm it.</p><p>
<b>Success</b>  The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was something harmless instead of charming touch, unless it identifies the spell (usually by Identifying Magic, page 305).</p><p>
<b>Failure</b>  The target's attitude becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.v66R7FdOf11l94im]{Friendly} toward you. If it was @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.v66R7FdOf11l94im]{Friendly}, it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.v44P3WUcU1j0115l]{Helpful}. It can't use hostile actions against you.</p><p>
<b>Critical Failure</b>  The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.v44P3WUcU1j0115l]{Helpful} and can't use hostile actions against you.</p><p>
<hr><b>Heightened (4th)</b>  You can target any type of creature, not just humanoids, as long as it could find you attractive.</p>
