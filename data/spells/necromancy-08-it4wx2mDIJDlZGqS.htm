RangeEN: 120 feet
------ Description (en) ------
<p>You call forth a divine cataclysm from your deity, destroying living and undead creatures in the area alike. Creatures in the area take 10d6 Negative Damage and [[/r 10d6]] alignment damage (good, evil, lawful, or chaotic), chosen from among the alignments your deity has. If your deity is true neutral, increase the negative damage by [[/r 4d6 #negative]]{4d6 Negative Damage} instead of dealing alignment damage. A creature harmed by positive damage, such as one with negative healing, takes positive damage instead of negative damage from this spell.</p>
<p>You can't cast this spell if you don't have a deity. This spell gains the trait corresponding to the alignment damage dealt.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 1d6 negative damage, [[/r 1d6]] alignment damage, and 1d6 additional negative and positive damage for a true neutral deity.</p>
