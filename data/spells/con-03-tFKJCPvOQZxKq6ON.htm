État: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Magical monkey spirits fill the area as they pile and climb on top of one another. Because the monkeys are magical spirits, they can’t be attacked or hurt. Casting @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.b515AZlB0sridKSq]{Calm Emotions}&nbsp;or a similar effect over the monkeys makes them docile, causing them to cease making mischief for the duration of <em>mad monkeys</em>.</p>
<p>Choose the kind of mischief your monkeys make when you @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast the Spell}. They produce the effect listed for that mischief when you Cast the Spell and each round when you @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.3f5DMFu8fPiqHpRg]{Sustain the Spell}. When you Sustain the Spell, you can move the area of the monkeys by 5 feet.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Flagrant Burglary</strong> The monkeys try to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.RDXXE7wMrSPCLv5k]{Steal} any one item from one creature in the area. Use your spell DC - 10 as the monkeys’ Thievery modifier. Their attempt relies more on distraction than subtlety, so the victim knows what item the monkeys were trying to take and whether it was taken. Getting a stolen item from the monkeys—even for the caster—requires Stealing it from them or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Dt6B1slsBy8ipJu9]{Disarming} them, using your spell DC. When the spell ends, any stolen items fall to the ground in any square of the spell’s area you choose.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Raucous Din</strong> The monkeys screech loudly, potentially deafening creatures in the spell’s area. Each creature in the spell’s area must attempt a Fortitude save.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.9PR9y0bi4JPKnHPR]{Deafened} for 1 round.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is Deafened for 1 minute.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Tumultuous Gymnastics</strong> The monkeys jump and climb all over creatures in the spell’s area, interfering with complex movements. Each creature in the spell’s area must attempt a Reflex save.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> For 1 round, the creature must succeed at a DC 5 flat check whenever it attempts a manipulate action. If it fails this check, the creature loses that action.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the monkeys cling to the creature tenaciously, and the effect lasts until the spell ends, even if the creature leaves the spell’s area.</p>
