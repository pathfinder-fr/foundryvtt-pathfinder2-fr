------ Description (en) ------
<p>Dense, twitching creepers sprout from every surface and fill any bodies of water in the area. Any creature moving on the land, or Climbing or Swimming within the creepers, takes a &ndash;10- foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds while in the area. Once per round, you can make a vine lash out from any square within the expanse of creepers by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. This vine has a 15-foot reach and makes a melee unarmed attack using your spell attack modifier. If the attack succeeds, the vine pulls the target into the creepers and makes it @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} for 1 round or until the creature Escapes (against your spell DC), whichever comes first.</p>
