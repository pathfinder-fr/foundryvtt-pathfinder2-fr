------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your words bless a creature with an enhanced connection to positive energy. When the target regains Hit Points from a healing spell, it regains 1 additional Hit Point. The target regains additional Hit Points from healer's blessing only the first time it regains HP from a given healing spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly over a duration would restore additional Hit Points only once.</p>
