------ Description (en) ------
<p>You create a sticky web in the area that impedes creatures' movement each time they try to move through it. Squares filled with the web are difficult terrain. Each square can be cleared of the web by a single attack or effect that deals at least 5 slashing damage or 1 fire damage. A square has AC 5, and it automatically fails its saving throws.</p>
<p>Each time a creature in the web begins to use a move action or enters the web during a move action, it must attempt an Athletics check or Reflex save against your spell DC to avoid taking a circumstance penalty to its Speeds or becoming @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized}. A creature that gets out of the web ceases to take a circumstance penalty to its Speed from the web.</p>
