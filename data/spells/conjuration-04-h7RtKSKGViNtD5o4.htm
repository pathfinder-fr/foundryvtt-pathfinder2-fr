<p>Razor sharp coral growths erupt from the ground, transforming the landscape into a dangerous coral reef. You can create a third nonoverlapping burst if the centers of all three bursts are underwater. Creatures in the area when the spell is cast take 6d6 piercing damage and must attempt a basic Reflex save. A creature that critically fails its saving throw also takes [[/r 1d6 #persistent bleed]] @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Bleed Damage}. The area becomes difficult terrain and hazardous terrain. A creature that moves through the area takes [[/r 3 #piercing]]{3 piercing damage} for every square of that area it moves into.</p>
