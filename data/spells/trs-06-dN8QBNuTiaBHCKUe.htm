------ Description (en) ------
<p>You transform the target creature into a harmless animal appropriate to the area, with effects based on its Fortitude save.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target's body gains minor features of the harmless animal. Its insides churn as they partially transform, causing it to be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened} 1. When it recovers from the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened} condition, its features revert to normal.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target transforms for 1 minute but keeps its mind. If it spends all its actions on its turn concentrating on its original form, it can attempt a Will save to end the effect immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target is transformed into the chosen harmless animal, body and mind, for an unlimited duration.</p>
