You trade appearances with the target, with the effects depending on the result of the target’s Will saving throw. Willing and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} targets automatically critically fail this saving throw.<br><br><strong>Critical Success</strong> No effect.<br><strong>Success</strong> You take on the target’s appearance, and they take yours. This has the same effects as a 1st-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.i35dpZFI7jZcRoBo]{Illusory Disguise}&nbsp;spell, except that the target can’t Dismiss the disguise. The duration is 1 minute or until Dismissed.<br><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but the duration is 1 hour or until Dismissed.<br><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As success, but the duration is 24 hours.&nbsp;</span></p>
