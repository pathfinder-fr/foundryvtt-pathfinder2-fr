------ Description (en) ------
<p>You wrap the targeted creatures in thin, sickly green shrouds that sap information from attackers. The shroud settles about each target's shoulders, granting a +1 status bonus to AC and a +2 status bonus to Stealth checks, both only while the target is in dim light or darkness.</p>
<p>If a creature deals damage in melee to or touches a cloaked creature, the cloak wraps around the attacker, temporarily connecting the psyches of the cloaked creature and the attacker and violently prying a random piece of interesting information from the attacker's mind. The attacker takes 2d8 mental damage and must attempt a Will save.</p>
<p>Afterward, the spell ends for the cloaked creature, and the attacker is temporarily immune to <em>mirecloak</em> for 24 hours.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The attacker is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The attacker takes half damage.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The attacker takes full damage and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1}. In addition, the cloaked creature gleans a piece of information from the attacker's mind. The details and extent of this information are at the GM's discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the attacker takes double damage and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 2}.</p>
