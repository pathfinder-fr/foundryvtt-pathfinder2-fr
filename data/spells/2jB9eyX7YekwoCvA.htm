------ Description (en) ------
<p>You utter a liberating word of power that frees a creature. You suppress one of the following conditions of your choice: @JournalEntry[Confused], @JournalEntry[Frightened], @JournalEntry[Grabbed], or @JournalEntry[Paralyzed]. The target isn't affected by the chosen condition, and if you suppress the @JournalEntry[Grabbed] condition, the target automatically breaks free from any grab affecting it when you Cast the Spell.</p>
<p>If you don't remove the effect that provided the condition, the condition returns after the spell ends. For example, if a spell was making the target @JournalEntry[Confused] for 1 minute, word of freedom would let the target act normally for a round, but the @JournalEntry[Confused] condition would return afterward.</p>
