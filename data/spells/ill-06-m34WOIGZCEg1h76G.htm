------ Description (en) ------
<p>A flowing cloak of utter darkness drapes over you, filled with pinpricks of light like distant stars. It imparts the stillness of the cosmos to you, granting you a +2 status bonus to Stealth checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.XMcnh4cSI32tljXa]{Hide} and @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VMozDqMMuK5kpoX4]{Sneak}.</p>
<p>While outside under a starry night sky, you're also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible} as long as you remain still. When moving under a starry night sky, you are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} instead.</p>
<p>Gazing too closely into the stars is disorienting. Any creature that ends its turn adjacent to you must attempt a Will save; this is a mental, visual effect.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Success</strong>: The creature is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong>: The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong>: The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.yblD8fOR1J8rDwEQ]{Confused} and Dazzled until the end of its next turn.</p>
