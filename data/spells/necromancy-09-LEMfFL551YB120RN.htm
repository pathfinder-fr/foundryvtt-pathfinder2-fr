------ Description (en) ------
<p>You anoint the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.5Q5MfHX43Sjm8C6Z]{Final Blade}</em> with powdered mithral and grave dirt while speaking softly and carefully to the souls trapped within it. You create a mystical pathway for the souls to escape through and urge them to draw out the magic of the final blade with them as they depart.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> As success, and the souls also grant a boon; the primary and secondary casters gain a +2 status bonus to saves against death and fear effects for the next year.</p>
<p>@Compendium[pf2e.spell-effects.eotqxEWIgaK7nMpD]{Spell Effect: Blunt the Final Blade (Critical Success)}</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The souls escape the <em>final blade</em> and peacefully pass on to their eternal rewards, as appropriate for each soul. The final blade is no longer magical; it can't store anymore souls and can be destroyed as a normal guillotine.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The ritual has no effect.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The ritual goes horribly wrong. The souls within the <em>final blade</em> are released in a furious rush as a gray death that does its best to slay the ritual's casters and run amok among the living. The <em>final blade</em> retains it abilities and can continue to store souls.</p>
