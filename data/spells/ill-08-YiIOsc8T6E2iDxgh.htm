------ Description (en) ------
<p>You lash a target with tendrils of shadow that steal some of its substance, making it quasi-real. As long as it is quasi-real, its Strikes deal half damage, it can't critically succeed at any skill check, and creatures attempting saving throws against its spells and effects get a result one degree of success better than they rolled. The target must attempt a Will saving throw.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is quasi-real until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is quasi-real for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt another Will save, ending the spell on a success.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target is quasi-real for an unlimited duration.</p>
