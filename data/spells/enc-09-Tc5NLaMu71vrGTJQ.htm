------ Description (en) ------
<p>Animals and plants in the area turn against the targets. Each target suffers from the following effects as long as it remains in the area. Vegetation springs up from every surface, giving each target a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed any time it's adjacent to the plants. Aggressive animals attack unpredictably. At the start of its turn, each target rolls a DC 8 flat check. On a failure, it's attacked by swarming creatures that deal 2d10 slashing damage. The target attempts a basic Reflex save, and it is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} for 1 round on any outcome other than a critical success. The target loses any connection to nature or natural creatures. The target has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check when casting any primal spell or the spell fails. Furthermore, animal or plant creatures become hostile to it, even one with a strong bond to the target, such as an animal companion. The GM might decide that you can't subject some creatures, such as an emissary of a nature deity, to the ire of nature.</p>
