Nom: Secret effroyable

------ Description (en) ------
<p>You utter a powerful secret at odds with the fundamental<br />nature of the target creatures. Choose a specific resistance or weakness that you believe one or more of the targets have due to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.1OagaWtBpVXExToo]{Recall Knowledge} or previous experience with the targets, such as resistance to fire or weakness to silver. If the information is incorrect for a given target, the spell has no effect on that target. Affected targets must attempt a Will saving throw.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes 1 damage of the type of weakness you chose (thus triggering the creature's weakness), or loses its resistance until the end of your next turn if you chose a resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, and the creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened} 1 from the revelation of its dread secret.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except the creature is Frightened 3.</p>
