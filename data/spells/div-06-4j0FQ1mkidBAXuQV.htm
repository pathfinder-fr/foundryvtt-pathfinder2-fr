<p id="docs-internal-guid-3e0c0ab4-7fff-869a-cf23-f4e2024eb196" dir="ltr">You gain the ability to perform a specialized combat technique from the vast wealth of martial knowledge your mystery provides. When you @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast this Spell}, you use the action granted by one common fighter feat from pages 144-153 of the Core Rulebook or pages 126-127 of this book (your GM might add feats to this list). If you Cast this Spell using 2 actions, the granted action must be a single action, and if you Cast this Spell using 3 actions, you can instead choose a feat that grants a 2-action activity. The chosen feat's level can be no higher than heroic feat's spell level. The feat can't have a Frequency entry, and you must meet its prerequisites and requirements in order to select it.</p>
