Name: Nudge Fate
Nom: Coup de pouce au destin
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>You read slightly into the future and give fate a tiny push to achieve the result you desire. Once during the duration, when the target fails an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw and a +1 status bonus would turn a critical failure into a failure, or failure into a success, you grant the target a +1 status bonus to the check retroactively, changing the outcome appropriately. The spell then ends, and the target is temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>
<p>If you cast nudge fate while a previous casting of this hex is still in effect, the previous effect ends.</p>
