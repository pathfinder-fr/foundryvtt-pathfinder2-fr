------ Description (en) ------
<p>Drawing your hand in a sweeping gesture, you shroud the target in a veil of night. The target’s eyes are blanketed in darkness. If you cast this hex on a willing ally (for instance, one with light blindness), the ally can choose which result it gets without rolling. Regardless of the outcome, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Success</strong>: The target is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong>: The target is shrouded in murky darkness. Unless the target has @Compendium[pf2e.ancestryfeatures.HHVQDp61ehcpdiU8]{Darkvision}, other creatures are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} to it.</p>
