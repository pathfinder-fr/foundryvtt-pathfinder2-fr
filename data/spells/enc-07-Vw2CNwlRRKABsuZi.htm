------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your eyes glow with an entrancing radiance that captivates those who meet your gaze. Any creature that ends its turn within the emanation must attempt a Will save.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected and becomes immune to this particular casting of the spell.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Failure</strong> Until the end of its next turn, the target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied} 2 and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AdPVz7rbaVSRxHFg]{Fascinated}.</span></p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Until the end of its next turn, the target is Stupefied 4, Fascinated, and can't take reactions. In addition, all creatures and objects other than you are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} from the target.</p>
<hr />
<p>During any round you Sustain the Spell, you can use a single action, which has the manipulate trait, to focus your entrancing eyes on a single creature you can see within 30 feet. This creature must immediately make a Will save against  the spell as if it were ending its turn in the emanation. If the creature was already Fascinated by your entrancing eyes before its save, a failed save causes it to be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed} for 1 round. You can't use this action to focus on the same creature more than once per round.</p>
