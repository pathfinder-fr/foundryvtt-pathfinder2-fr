------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your litany rails against the sin of wrath, punishing the target for attacking good creatures. The target must attempt a Will save. A particularly wrathful creature, such as a wrath demon, uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw. The target then becomes temporarily immune to all of your litanies for 1 minute.</p><p>
<hr><b>Critical Success</b>  The target is unaffected.</p><p>
<b>Success</b>  The first time the target uses an action that deals damage to at least one good creature, the target takes 3d6 good damage.</p><p>
<b>Failure</b>  Each time the target uses an action that deals damage to at least one good creature, the target takes 3d6 good damage.</p><p>
<b>Critical Failure</b>  The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled} 2. Each time it uses an action that deals damage to at least one good creature, the target takes 3d6 good damage.</p><p>
<hr><b>Heightened (+1)</b>  The damage increases by 1d6.</p>
