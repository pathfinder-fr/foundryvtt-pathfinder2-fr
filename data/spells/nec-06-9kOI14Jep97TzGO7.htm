------ Description (en) ------
<p dir="ltr">You transcend your physical form, becoming a beacon of healing energy. Your body exudes bright light like a torch. You gain resistance 5 to precision damage and weakness 5 to negative damage, and your unarmed @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strikes} deal an extra [[/r 1d4 #positive]] positive damage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You can touch a living creature with an @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F]{Interact} action to restore [[/r 6d8]] Hit Points to it, and when a creature touches you with an Interact action you can allow it to gain the same healing; either way, the creature becomes temporarily immune to life-giving form's healing for 1 minute. This is a positive healing effect. You can't heal yourself with life-giving form. A creature harmed by positive damage (such as an undead) that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon instead takes [[/r 3d4 #positive]] positive damage, and it doesn't become temporarily immune. You can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.AjLSHZSWQ90exdLo]{Dismiss} this spell.</p>
