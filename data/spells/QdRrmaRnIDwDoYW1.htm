------ Description (en) ------
<p>You project psychic vibrations onto the target object, imprinting it with a short message or emotional theme of your design. This imprinted sensation is revealed to anyone casting object reading on the target object, replacing any emotional events the item was present for. If the object is in the area of a retrocognition spell, the imprinted messages appear as major events in the timeline, but they don’t interfere with any other visions. If the object is targeted with read aura of a higher spell level than imprint message, the caster learns that the object has been modified. When you Cast this Spell, any prior vibrations placed in an object by previous castings of imprint message fade.&nbsp;</p>
