<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Your touch disrupts the connection between body and soul, possibly forcing the soul out of the body altogether. The target must attempt a Fortitude save. You can allow allies to choose the degree of success instead of rolling a saving throw.<br /><br /><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected.<br /><strong>Failure</strong> The target is <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=36">stunned 1</a> as its soul briefly loses its connection to its body.<br /><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target&rsquo;s soul exits its body for 1 round. The target&rsquo;s body becomes stunned. While its body is stunned in this way, the target remains fully aware in soul form; it simply can&rsquo;t consciously move its body (though the body makes basic instinctual defensive movements). The target&rsquo;s soul has the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=222">incorporeal</a> trait, is <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=26">invisible</a>, and has a fly Speed of 60 feet. It can&rsquo;t attack, cast spells, or attempt any skill checks that require a physical body, and it must always maintain line of effect to its body. When the target&rsquo;s body ceases being stunned, the target&rsquo;s soul instantly returns to its body as the target wakes.</span></p>
