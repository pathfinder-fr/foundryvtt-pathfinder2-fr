------ Description (en) ------
<p>Restorative magic counters the effects of toxins or conditions that prevent a creature from functioning at its best. When you cast restoration, choose to either reduce a condition or lessen the effect of a toxin. A creature can benefit from only one restoration spell each day, and it can't benefit from restoration more than once to reduce the stage of the same exposure to a given toxin.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lessen a Toxin</strong> Reduce the stage of one toxin the target suffers from by one stage. This can't reduce the stage below stage 1 or cure the affliction.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce a Condition</strong> Reduce the value of the target's @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.i3OJZU2nk64Df3xm]{Clumsy}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled}, or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied} condition by 2. You can instead reduce two of the listed conditions by 1 each.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> Add @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained} to the list of conditions you can reduce. When you lessen a toxin, reduce the stage by two. You also gain a third option that allows you to reduce the target's @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed} value by 1. You can't use this to reduce a permanent @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed} condition.</p>
<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> As the 4th-level restoration, but you can reduce a permanent @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed} condition if you add a spellcasting action and a material component while Casting the Spell, during which you provide 100 gp worth of diamond dust as a cost.</p>
