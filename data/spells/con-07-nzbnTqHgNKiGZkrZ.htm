------ Description (en) ------
<p>You bind yourself and your allies to the specific safe location&nbsp;where you perform the ritual. This allows the participants to&nbsp;return later by simply speaking a word.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Success</strong> You form the connection with the designated&nbsp;sanctuary. Any participant in the ritual can spend a single&nbsp;action, which has the concentrate trait, to utter a word of&nbsp;power you choose when you cast the spell. When they do,&nbsp;all the participants can immediately return to the sanctuary&nbsp;from any distance, as long as they are on the same plane&nbsp;as the sanctuary. Each participant arrives in the position in&nbsp;which they were standing during the casting of the ritual.&nbsp;When the word is spoken, all other participants know it, and&nbsp;each can choose whether or not to return to the sanctuary&nbsp;at that time. The ritual then immediately ends.</p>
<p><strong>Failure </strong>You fail to form the connection between the participants&nbsp;and the sanctuary and are aware that the ritual has failed.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The ritual inadvertently forms a connection&nbsp;with a location on another plane. The casters are unaware&nbsp;of this misalignment. When the word is invoked, all ritual&nbsp;participants are shifted to this extraplanar location.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Heightened (+1) </strong>The cost increases by 5,000 gp, the ritual&nbsp;can target one more creature, and the maximum level of&nbsp;creature it can target increases by 2.</p>
