------ Description (en) ------
<p>Siphoning negative energy into yourself, your hand radiates a pale darkness. Your touch weakens the living and disorients undead, possibly even causing them to flee. The effect depends on whether the target is living or undead.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Living Creature</strong> The spell deals negative damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting modifier. The target attempts a basic Fortitude save, but is also @JournalEntry[Enfeebled] 1 for 1 round on a critical failure.</li>
<li><strong>Undead Creature</strong> The target is @JournalEntry[Flat-Footed] for 1 round on a failed Fortitude save. On a critical failure, the target is also @JournalEntry[Fleeing] for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Will save.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The negative damage to living creatures increases by 1d4.</p>
