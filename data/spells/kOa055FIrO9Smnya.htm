------ Description (en) ------
<p>You shape a wall of solid stone. You create a 1-inch-thick wall of stone up to 120 feet long, and 20 feet high. You can shape the wall's path, placing each 5 feet of the wall on the border between squares. The wall doesn't need to stand vertically, so you can use it to form a bridge or set of stairs, for example. You must conjure the wall in an un@JournalEntry[Broken] open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. Each 5-foot-by-5-foot section of the wall has AC 10, Hardness 14, and 50 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits and precision damage. A destroyed section of the wall can be moved through, but the rubble created from it is difficult terrain.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The Hit Points of each section of the wall increase by 15.</p>
