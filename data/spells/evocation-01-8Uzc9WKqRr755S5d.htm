------ Description (en) ------
<p>You gather magical energy into your palm, forming a concentrated ball of electricity that crackles and rumbles like impossibly distant thunder. Make a ranged spell attack roll against your target's AC. On a success, you deal 3d6 electricity damage. On a critical success, the target takes double damage and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} for 1 round. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines the range and other parameters.</p>
<p><span class="pf2-icon">2</span> <strong>(somatic, verbal)</strong> This spell has a range of 30 feet.</p>
<p><span class="pf2-icon">3</span> <strong>(material, somatic, verbal)</strong> This spell has a range of 60 feet and deals half damage on a failure (but not a critical failure) as the electricity lashes out and jolts the target.</p>
<p><strong>Two Rounds</strong> If you spend 3 actions Casting the Spell, you can avoid finishing the spell and spend another 3 actions on your next turn to empower the spell even further. If you do, after attacking the target, whether you hit or miss, the ball of lightning explodes, dealing [[/r 2d6 #electricity]]{2d6 electricity damage} to all other creatures in a 10-foot emanation around the target (basic Reflex save). Additionally, you spark with electricity for 1 minute, dealing [[/r 1 #electricity]]{1 electricity damage} to creatures that Grab you or that hit you with an unarmed Strike or a non-reach melee weapon.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The initial damage on a hit, as well as the burst damage for two-round casting time, each increase by [[/r 2d6 #electricity]], and the damage creatures take if they Grapple or hit you while you're in your sparking state increases by [[/r 1 #electricity]].</p>
