------ Description (en) ------
<p>The target becomes a scrying sensor, allowing you to see through its eyes, smell what it smells, and similarly use its other senses. If you can cast a spell with the revelation trait that affects your senses, such as @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.jwK43yKsHTkJQvQ9]{See Invisibility}, while this spell is active, you gain the benefit of the spell through the target's senses instead of your own. You can also speak through the target, with a voice much like yours, though it takes on some of the timbre and character of the target's growls or squawks. You can use @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.q9nbyIF0PEBqMtYe]{Command an Animal} on the target as part of @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.3f5DMFu8fPiqHpRg]{Sustaining this Spell}. You don't need line of sight or line of effect to your target when you @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast this Spell}.</p>
