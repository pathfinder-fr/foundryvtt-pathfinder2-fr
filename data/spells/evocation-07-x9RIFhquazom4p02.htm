<p>A manifested version of your deity's favored weapon appears in the air above and attacks the target, using your spell attack roll. On a hit, the weapon deals 7d12 force damage, or double damage on a critical hit.</p>
<p>After the attack, whether it succeeds or fails, divine energy bursts from the weapon in a shock wave. It emits in a <strong>10-foot-wide, 30-foot-long line</strong> starting from the target and continuing in a direction you choose. Choose an alignment your deity has (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). Your target and any other creatures within the area of the spell take [[/r 5d6]] damage of the chosen alignment type, with a <span data-pf2-check="reflex" data-pf2-label="Deity's Strike DC" data-pf2-show-dc="gm">basic Reflex</span> save.
