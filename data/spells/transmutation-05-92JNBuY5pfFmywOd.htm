<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A shield within range would be reduced to 0 Hit Points by a damaging effect</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The triggering shield had more than 1 Hit Point before taking damage.</p>
<hr />
<p>You hold a shield together with the power of your magic, forcing wood and steel to fuse back together. The shield remains at 1 Hit Point and isn't destroyed. Its construction is weakened until someone takes the time to repair it, preventing <em>desperate repair</em> or a similar ability from saving the same shield until your next daily preparations.</p>
