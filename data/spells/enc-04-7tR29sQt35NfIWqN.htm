------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature performs an act anathema to your deity.</p>
<hr>
<p>You punish a creature that transgresses against your deity, drawing upon the anguish you feel upon seeing one of your deity's anathema committed. You can cast this spell only when a creature actively commits a unique act of anathema. For example, if creating undead were anathema to your deity, you could use anathematic reprisal on a necromancer who had just created undead in front of you, but not on an undead creature just for existing. You deal 4d6 mental damage to the target, but a basic Will save can reduce this damage. If it fails, it is also <a class="entity-link" data-pack="pf2e.conditionspf2e" data-id="e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg" draggable="true"><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> Stupefied</a> 1 for 1 round. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 1d6.</p>
