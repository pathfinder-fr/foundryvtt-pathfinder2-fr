Name: Anathematic Reprisal
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>You punish a creature that transgresses against your deity, drawing upon the anguish you feel upon seeing one of your deity's anathema committed. You can cast this spell only when a creature actively commits a unique act of anathema. For example, if creating undead were anathema to your deity, you could use anathematic reprisal on a necromancer who had just created undead in front of you, but not on an undead creature just for existing. You deal 4d6 mental damage to the target, but a basic Will save can reduce this damage. If it fails, it is also @JournalEntry[Stupefied] 1 for 1 round. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p><p>
<hr><hr><b>Heightened (+1)</b>  The damage increases by 1d6.</p>
