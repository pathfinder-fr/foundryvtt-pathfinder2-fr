<p><strong>Trigger </strong>A creature’s @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{Dying} condition would reach the value at which they would die.</p>
<hr>
<p>Your ode temporarily staves off death. The target’s dying condition remains 1 below the value at which it dies. This doesn’t help prevent death from effects that kill the target without increasing its dying condition, such as @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.r7ihOgKv19eJQnik]{Disintegrate} and death effects.</p>
