------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You call forth a swirling storm of dust. The <em>dust storm</em> obscures vision, with the effect of @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.9XHmC2JgTUIQ1CCm]{Obscuring Mist}. The dust also makes the air unbreathable; creatures in the area must <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=468">hold their breath</a>, though wearing a scarf or similar clothing over the mouth increases the time the creature can hold its breath to 5 rounds. Creatures entering or starting their turn in the <em>dust storm</em> take 1d6 slashing damage. Creatures that have the water trait or that are made primarily of liquid take double damage.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The damage increases by 1d6.&nbsp;</p>
