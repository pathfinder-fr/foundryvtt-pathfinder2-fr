------ Description (en) ------
<p>You briefly turn your attack into pure force to bypass your opponent's defenses. Choose a target within your reach, or within the reach of a melee weapon you're wielding. If you can use @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.QDW9H8XLIjuW2fE4]{Spellstrike} with a ranged weapon (with the starlit span hybrid study, for example), you can target a creature in the first range increment of your ranged weapon. For an instant, you transform your weapon or unarmed attack into a spike of pure force, replacing all its normal statistics and abilities. The force fang automatically deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to the target.</p>
