Name: Chromatic Wall
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>You create an opaque wall of light in a single vibrant color. The wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet long and 30 feet high. If the wall would pass through a creature, the spell is lost. The wall sheds bright light for 20 feet on each side, and dim light for the next 20 feet. You can ignore the wall's effects.</p>
<p>Roll 1d4 to determine the color of the wall. Each color has a particular effect on items, effects, or creatures that attempt to pass through. Chromatic wall can't be counteracted normally; rather, each color is automatically counteracted when targeted by a specific spell, even if that spell's level is lower than that of chromatic wall.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Red</strong> The wall destroys ranged weapon ammunition (such as arrows and crossbow bolts) that would pass through, and it deals 20 fire damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. Cone of cold can counteract a red chromatic wall.</li>
<li><strong>Orange</strong> The wall destroys thrown weapons that would pass through, and it deals 25 acid damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. Gust of wind can counteract an orange chromatic wall.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow</strong> The wall stops acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive, and sonic effects from passing through, and it deals 30 electricity damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. Disintegrate can counteract a yellow chromatic wall.</li>
<li><strong>Green</strong> The wall stops toxins, gases, and breath weapons from passing through. It deals 10 poison damage to anyone passing through and makes them @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled} 1 for 1 minute. A basic Fortitude save reduces the damage and negates the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled} condition on a success. Passwall can counteract a green chromatic wall.<hr /></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong>&nbsp;The spell's duration increases to 1 hour. Roll 1d8 to determine the wall's color; the results for 5&ndash;8 are below. A red, orange, yellow, or green wall deals an extra 10 damage.</p>
<p><strong>5. Blue</strong> The wall stops auditory, petrification, and visual effects from passing through, and creatures passing through are subject to the effects of flesh to stone. Magic missile can counteract a blue chromatic wall.</p>
<p><strong>6. Indigo</strong> The wall stops divination and mental effects from passing through, and those passing through are subject to the effects of warp mind. Searing light can counteract an indigo chromatic wall.</p>
<p><strong>7. Violet</strong> The wall prevents spells from targeting the other side (area effects still cross as normal). Creatures passing through must succeed at a Will save or they are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed} 1 for 1 minute; on a critical failure, the creature is instead sent to another plane, with the effect of plane shift . Dispel magic can counteract a violet chromatic wall.</p>
<p><strong>8. Reroll</strong>, and creatures that pass through the wall take a &ndash;2 circumstance penalty to their saves.</p>
