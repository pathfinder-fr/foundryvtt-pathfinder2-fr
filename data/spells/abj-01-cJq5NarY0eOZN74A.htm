<p><strong><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Trigger&nbsp;</span></strong>An ally within 30 feet is about to attempt a saving throw against a harmful emotion effect, and you would not otherwise have to save against the effect.</p>
<hr />
<p>You shoulder some of your ally&rsquo;s pain. Both you and your ally use the outcome one degree of success better than the result of your ally&rsquo;s saving throw, even if the triggering effect usually affects only one target.&nbsp;</p>
