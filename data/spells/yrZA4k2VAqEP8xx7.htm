------ Description (en) ------
<p>You manifest an aura that prevents creatures from approaching you. When casting the spell, you can make the area any radius you choose, up to 40 feet. A creature must attempt a Will save if it's within the area when you cast the spell or as soon as it enters the area while the spell is in effect. Once a creature has attempted the save, it uses the same result for that casting of repulsion. Any restrictions on a creature's movement apply only if it voluntarily moves toward you. For example, if you move closer to a creature, it doesn't then need to move away.</p><p>
<hr><b>Critical Success</b>  The creature's movement is not restricted.</p><p>
<b>Success</b>  The creature treats each square in the area as difficult terrain when moving closer to you.</p><p>
<b>Failure</b>  The creature can't move closer to you within the area.</p>
