------ Description (en) ------
<p>A phantasmal image of the most precious thing imaginable to the target appears in a location of your choice within the spell’s range. Only the spell’s target can see the treasure, though you can see the vague shape of the treasure—be it a pile of items, a deific avatar, or a cherished loved one or hero. The target’s response to the treasure is based on the outcome of the target’s Will save.</p>

<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As success, but the duration is 1 minute. The target finds the treasure so appealing that until the spell ends, it must spend each action focused on it.

(If the illusion appears to be a person or the like, the target can also Interact to converse with it.)</p>
