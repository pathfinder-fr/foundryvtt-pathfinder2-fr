<p><strong>Trigger</strong>&nbsp;A creature within range that you can see&nbsp;Casts a Spell.</p>
<hr>
<p>You undermine the target spell, making it easier to defend against. You reduce the spell's level by 1, and targets of the spell gain a +2 status bonus to any saving throws, skill checks, AC, or DC against it. You can't reduce the spell's level below its minimum. For example, a 5th-level cone of cold would remain 5th-level, but a 5th-level fireball would become 4th-level. Targets still gain all the other benefits, even if you don't reduce the spell's level.</p>
