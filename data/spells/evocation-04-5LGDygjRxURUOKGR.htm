------ Description (en) ------
<p>You fire a beam of blinding light from your outstretched hands. The beam deals 5d10 good damage. On a failed saving throw, a creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} for 1 round, or dazzled for 4 rounds on a critical failure.</p>
<p>If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, radiant beam attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the target.</p>
