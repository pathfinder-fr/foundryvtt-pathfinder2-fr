------ Description (en) ------
<p>Creatures in the area are outlined by glittering dust. Each creature must attempt a Reflex save. If a creature has its invisibility negated by this spell, it is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} instead of @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible}. This applies both if the creature was already @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible} and if it benefits from new invisibility effects before the end of the invisibility negation effect from this spell.</p><p>
