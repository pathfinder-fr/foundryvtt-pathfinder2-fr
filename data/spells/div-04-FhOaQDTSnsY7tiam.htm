Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>You alter the target's memories, either erasing a memory, enhancing a memory's clarity, altering a memory, or adding a false memory. The target can attempt a Will save to resist the spell.Any memories you've altered remain changed as long as the spell is active. If the target moves out of range before the 5 minutes is up, you can't alter any further memories.</p><p>
<hr><b>Critical Success</b>  The target is unaffected and realizes you tried to alter its memory.</p><p>
<b>Success</b>  The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was something harmless instead of modify memory, unless it identifies the spell.</p><p>
<b>Failure</b>  During the first 5 minutes of the spell's duration, you can Sustain the Spell to modify a memory once each round. When you do, you imagine up to 6 seconds of memory to modify, to a maximum of 5 continuous minutes of memory.</p><p>
<hr><b>Heightened (6th)</b>  You can cast the spell on a willing target to suppress all memory of a particular topic, detailed in 50 words or fewer. The effect is permanent, and it patches these omissions with an indistinct haze.</p>
