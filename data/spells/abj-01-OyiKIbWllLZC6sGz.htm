<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within range is attacked.</p>
<hr />

The target vanishes in a burst of brightly colored smoke and sparkles, reappearing an instant later. They become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} against the triggering attack and until the end of the current creature's turn.</p>
