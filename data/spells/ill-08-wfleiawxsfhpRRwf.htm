------ Description (en) ------
<p>You shroud a creature from others' senses. The target becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected}, not just to sight but to all senses, allowing the target to count as @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible} no matter what precise and imprecise senses an observer might have. It's still possible for a creature to find the target by Seeking, looking for disturbed dust, hearing gaps in the sound spectrum, or finding some other way to discover the presence of an otherwise-undetectable creature.</p>
