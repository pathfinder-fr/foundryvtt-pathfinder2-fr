------ Description (en) ------
<p>You alter a creature's shadow, transforming it into a terrifying monster out to devour the creature. The creature must attempt a Will save. A creature that has the frightened condition from <em>unspeakable shadow</em> must spend at least one of its actions each turn to either attack its shadow (making a Strike ineffectually) or flee from its shadow (using one action to move away as though it had the fleeing condition).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2}.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 3}. It can't reduce its frightened value below 1 for 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target is so afraid, it might instantly die. It must succeed at a Fortitude save or die; this saving throw has the incapacitation trait. If it succeeds at its save, the target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 4} and can't reduce its frightened value below 1 for 1 minute.</p>
