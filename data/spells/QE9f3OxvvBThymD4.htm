------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You force the Material and Ethereal Planes to partially overlap, creating a zone that causes incorporeal and spiritual entities to take on many of the aspects of corporeal creatures. Within the ectoplasmic interstice, <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=222">incorporeal</a> creatures cannot pass through solid objects or corporeal creatures, and they can manipulate and attempt Strength-based checks against physical creatures and objects. An incorporeal PC or other creature with a normal Strength modifier simply uses that modifier, but if the creature had a Strength modifier of –5, like most incorporeal monsters, it uses a +4 modifier instead, increasing its <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=3">Athletics</a> modifier by 9 accordingly. Attacks against creatures that are within the interstice overcome resistances as if they were by <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=297"><em>ghost touch</em></a> weapons.&nbsp;</span></p>
