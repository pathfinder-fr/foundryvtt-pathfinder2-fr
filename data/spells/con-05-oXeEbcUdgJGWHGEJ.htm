------ Description (en) ------
<p>You conjure a spike that thrusts up from the earth beneath a target creature, potentially impaling it. The spike is made of cold iron and deals [[/r 8d6 #piercing (cold iron)]] piercing damage. The target must attempt a Reflex save.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong>: The target dodges the spike and is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong>: The target is struck by the spike and takes half damage.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong>: The target is impaled through a leg or another non - vital body part. The creature takes full damage and, if it's standing on solid ground, becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized}. It can attempt to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escape}(the DC is your spell DC). While it remains impaled, it takes damage from any weakness to cold iron it has at the end of each of its turns.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong>: As failure, but the creature is impaled through a vital organ or its center of mass, taking double damage, and it is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} as long as it's impaled.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by [[/r 2d6 #piercing (cold iron)]].</p>
