<p>You instruct the target to do something, compelling obedience by calling it by its true name. Your instructions can't be self-destructive. Though this spell has the linguistic trait, this applies only to the instructions; the creature doesn't need to know its own true name to be affected. The target must attempt a Will saving throw.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected, is temporarily immune to further castings of this spell by you for 1 week, and learns your true name.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected, is temporarily immune to further castings of this spell by you for 1 day, and learns a fragment of your true name.</p>

<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the spell's duration is 8 hours, and the creature is not temporarily immune.</p>
