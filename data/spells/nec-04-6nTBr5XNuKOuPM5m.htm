------ Description (en) ------
<p>You multiply the disease within a creature, drawing it into an infectious mist outside their body where it can spread to other creatures. The target must attempt a Will save. If the target is willing, it can choose to take the effects of critical failure.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target receives the benefit of a successful save against the lowest-level disease affecting it.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Failure</strong> One randomly chosen disease affecting the target fills the air in a 15-foot emanation centered on the target. For the spell's duration, any creature that enters or ends its turn within the area is exposed to that disease.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except the miasma contains all the diseases affecting the target. </span></p>
