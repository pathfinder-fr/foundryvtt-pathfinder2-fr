On a failed save, the Slowed condition increases by 1 (2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the Slowed condition by 1. When a creature is unable to act due to the Slowed condition from medusa’s wrath, it is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.dTwPJuKgBQCMxixg]{Petrified} permanently. The spell ends if the creature is Petrified or the Slowed condition is removed.</span></p>
