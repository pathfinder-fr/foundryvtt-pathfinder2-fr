------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You strike mention of a specific name from one or more documents. When you cast the spell, give one proper name, be it a creature, location, or object. Any mention of that name within the document becomes blurred, smudged, or otherwise completely illegible. Epithets and unambiguous references to the name are redacted as well; for instance, redacting the name of the goddess <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=16">Sarenrae</a> from a book would also remove references to her title “the Dawnflower.”</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> Instead of striking out a given name, you can replace it with a different name you choose. Epithets and references are substituted with similar ones relating to the replacement name. Anyone reading the text can attempt a Perception or <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=14">Society</a> check against your spell DC to notice the altered text, though that doesn’t tell them what the original said.<br><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> At your choice, the duration is unlimited.&nbsp;</p>
