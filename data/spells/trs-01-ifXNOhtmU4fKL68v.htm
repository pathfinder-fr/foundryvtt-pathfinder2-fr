------ Description (en) ------
<p><span>You strike mention of a specific name from one or more documents. When you cast the spell, give one proper name, be it a creature, location, or object. Any mention of that name within the document becomes blurred, smudged, or otherwise completely illegible. Epithets and unambiguous references to the name are redacted as well; for instance, redacting the name of the goddess @Compendium[pf2e.deities.BNycwu3I21dTh4D9]{Sarenrae} from a book would also remove references to her title &quot;the Dawnflower.&quot;</span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> Instead of striking out a given name, you can replace it with a different name you choose. Epithets and references are substituted with similar ones relating to the replacement name. Anyone reading the text can attempt a Perception or Society check against your spell DC to notice the altered text, though that doesn't tell them what the original said.</p>
<p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> At your choice, the duration is unlimited. </p>
