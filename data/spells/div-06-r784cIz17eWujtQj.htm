------ Description (en) ------
<p>You magically spy on a creature of your choice. Scrying works like @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.zvKWclOZ7A53DObE]{Clairvoyance}, except that the image you receive is less precise, insuficient for teleport and similar spells. Instead of creating an eye in a set location within 500 feet, you instead create an eye that manifests just above the target. You can choose a target either by name or by touching one of its possessions or a piece of its body. If you haven't met the target in person, scrying's DC is 2 lower, and if you are unaware of the target's identity (perhaps because you found an unknown creature's fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 lower. The effect of scrying depends on the target's Will save.</p>
