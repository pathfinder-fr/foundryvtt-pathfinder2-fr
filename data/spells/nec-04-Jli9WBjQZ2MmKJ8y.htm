------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Memories of a past life that seem incredibly real (and may even be) overwhelm the target’s mind. This is especially disorienting for undead and creatures that have lived a previous life (such as celestials, fiends, monitors, and many other extraplanar creatures); if such creatures roll a critical success on their save, they get a success instead, and if they roll a failure, they get a critical failure instead.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.<br><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed} 1 for 1 round.<br><strong>Failure</strong> The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed} 1 for 1 minute and babbles about the visions, possibly providing information about what they saw.<br><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target is also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned} 3.</span></p>
