------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You blast the area with grit that scours away soil and gets into creatures’ eyes. For the duration of the spell, any plant-based difficult terrain smaller than a tree becomes loose, allowing each 5-foot square of it to be cleared with a single Interact action. In addition, <em>scouring sand</em> attempts to counteract @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.J6vNvrUT3b1hx2iA]{Entangle}&nbsp;and other effects that create or manipulate plant-based terrain in its area. Successfully counteracting an effect removes only the portion of its area that overlaps with <em>scouring sand’s</em> area. After one such attempt, the effect is temporarily immune to <em>scouring sand’s</em> counteract for 24 hours. Each creature in the area when you Cast this Spell or that ends its turn in the area must attempt a Reflex save.<br></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput"><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.<br><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} for 1 minute or until it uses an Interact action to get the sand out of its eyes.<br><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature is also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} for its next action.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> Once per round when you Sustain the Spell, you can move the center of the burst to a spot within range.<br><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> As the 3rd-level version, except the range is 120 feet and the area is a 20-foot burst.</p>
