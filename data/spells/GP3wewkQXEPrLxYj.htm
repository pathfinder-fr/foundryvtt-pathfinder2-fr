------ Description (en) ------
<p>You implant a subconscious suggestion deep within the target's mind for them to follow when a trigger you specify occurs (as described on page 305). You suggest a course of action to the target. Your directive must be phrased in such a way as to seem like a logical course of action to the target, and it can't be self-destructive or obviously against the target's self-interest. The target must attempt a Will save.</p><p>
<hr><b>Critical Success</b>  The target is unaffected and knows you tried to control it.</p><p>
<b>Success</b>  The target is unaffected and thinks you were talking to them normally, not casting a spell on them.</p><p>
<b>Failure</b>  The suggestion remains in the target's subconscious until the next time you prepare. If the trigger occurs before then, the target immediately follows your suggestion. The effect has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target has completed a finite suggestion or the suggestion becomes self-destructive or has other obvious negative effects.</p><p>
<b>Critical Failure</b>  As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.</p><p>
<hr><b>Heightened (9th)</b>  You can target up to 10 creatures.</p>
