ResetFR: 
RoutineEN: (9 actions) Each decoration uses 3 of the trap's actions each turn, and the trap loses 3 actions each turn for every decoration that is disabled. A decoration uses its first action to move its cloud of objects up to 200 feet, its second action to make the objects Strike, and its third action to add more objects to the cloud, increasing its damage by 1d12 (to a maximum of 4d12+10). If a decoration's cloud is already at maximum damage, it does nothing with its third action.<br />If a decoration's cloud has been destroyed, the decoration instead spends its first action to create a new cloud of objects inside the room (using the starting damage value) and then its second and third actions to have the cloud move and attack.
RoutineFR:
