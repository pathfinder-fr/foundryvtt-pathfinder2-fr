<hr>
<p>You are able to escape inquisitions involving divine magic, allowing you to blend in well in Mzali but also to avoid unwanted attention in other oppressive theocracies. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.RiuZT3H4QZIIEQXJ]{Slippery Secrets} skill feat, and its benefits also apply against divination effects that attempt to discern your deity. When using Slippery Secrets against a divine divination, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and on a critical success, the divination reveals false information appropriate to your false persona, rather than nothing.</p>
