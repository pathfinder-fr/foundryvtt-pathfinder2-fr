------ Description (en) ------
<p>You enhance your spell with elemental water, soaking the target.</p>
<p>If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell targeting a single creature, you soak the target of the spell with water. If the target has @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Acid or Fire Damage}, the DC to end those conditions is reduced to 10, and the creature can attempt a flat check to end those types of persistent damage immediately.</p>
<p>The spell gains the water trait (causing it to deal extra damage to creatures with weakness to water).</p>
