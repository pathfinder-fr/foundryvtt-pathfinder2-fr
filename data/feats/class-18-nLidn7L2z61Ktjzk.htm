<p>Your mind and body can, for a short time, withstand the devastation of overdrawing your curse.</p>
<p>When you would become overwhelmed by your curse, you can forestall the effects for up to 1 minute.

<p>At the end of the minute, the durations of any revelation spells you cast during that time end, you take the normal effects from being overwhelmed by your curse, and you must attempt a DC 40 Fortitude save.</p>
