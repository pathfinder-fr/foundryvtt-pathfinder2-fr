<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>trained in Intimidation</p>
<hr>
<p>Imitating animal threat displays, you make yourself appear larger and more imposing.</p>
<p>Roll one Intimidation check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.2u915NdUyQan6uKF]{Demoralize} and compare the result to the Will DC of each animal, fungus, and plant creature in a 15-foot cone. When you do, Demoralize gains the visual trait, and creatures are affected if they can see you. You don't take a penalty if the creature doesn't understand your language.</p>
