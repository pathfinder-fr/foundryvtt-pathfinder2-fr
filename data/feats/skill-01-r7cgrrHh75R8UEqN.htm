<hr>
<p>Members of your cult frequently pass themselves off as worshippers of other religions. You can use Occultism instead of Deception to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.AJstokjdG6iDjVjE]{Impersonate} a typical worshipper of another faith or to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.ewwCglB7XOPLUz72]{Lie} specifically to claim you are a member of the faith you are Impersonating. You still need to use the Deception skill to Impersonate a specific worshipper or to perform other deceptive actions, such as attempting to Lie about any other matter.</p>
