<hr />
<p>You've grown up around a forge and are well-suited to dealing with smoke and flame. Your flat check to remove persistent fire damage is DC 10 instead of DC 15, which is reduced to DC 5 with appropriate assistance. In addition, if you roll a success on a saving throw against suffocation or choking due to smoke or ash, you get a critical success instead.</p>
