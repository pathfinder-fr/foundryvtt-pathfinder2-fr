------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your spells become a radiant display of light and color.</p>
<p>If your next action is to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell} that doesn’t have the darkness trait, has no duration, and requires creatures to attempt a Reflex save, the spell explodes in a spray of scintillating lights, in addition to its other effects.</p>
<p>Each creature that failed its Reflex save against the spell is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} for 1 round, and those who critically failed are instead @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} for 1 round.</p>
