------ Description (en) ------
<p>Whether it's wooden stakes, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.efFe4EK7ThUrH446]{Holy Water}</em>, or more unusual tools, you always have just the right thing to handle an undead's unusual weaknesses and vulnerabilities. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.bh2jHyyYrkLMsIdX]{Prescient Planner} and @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.lHFz4MmebvPqTb0A]{Prescient Consumable} feats. When using Prescient Planner specifically to pull out an item you need to deal with an undead's weakness or vulnerability, you can pull out the item as a 2-action activity to remove your backpack (or similar container) and draw the item, rather than taking 1 minute.</p>
<p>If you have the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.HVP3ZGIOlxlFy0ni]{Hunter's Sanctum} feat, you keep your sanctum well stocked with the basics and can spend 1 hour in your sanctum refreshing your supplies in order to meet the requirements for Prescient Planner, even if you haven't been able to purchase goods.</p>
