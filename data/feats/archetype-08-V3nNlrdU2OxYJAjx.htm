<p>When you focus your magic on an ally, you can remove harmful conditions.</p>
<p>If your next action is to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell} from a spell slot, and that spell targets only a single ally, you can also attempt to remove a harmful condition from that ally. The condition must be one that could be removed by your Mercy feat, including those granted by later feats such as @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.kZdcoaTD849QalR9]{Greater Mercy}.</p>
<p>Attempt a counteract check based on the spell's DC and level. This effect is in addition to the normal effects of your spell.</p>
