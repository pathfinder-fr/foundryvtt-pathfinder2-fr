<p>It is paramount that you are understood and you understand others; language need not impede your message. You can cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.SwUiVavHKMWG7t5K]{Tongues} as a 5th-level divine innate spell once per day on yourself only. You gain a +1 status bonus to Diplomacy checks for the duration of the spell when speaking to creatures with whom you already shared a language before casting.</p>
