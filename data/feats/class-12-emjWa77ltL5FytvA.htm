<p>Leaping out from hiding, you assail your target when they least expect it. You Stride up to your Speed, but you must end your movement next to an enemy you’re hidden from or undetected by. You then Strike that enemy; you remain hidden from or undetected by that creature until after you Strike. You can use Spring from the Shadows while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.</p>
