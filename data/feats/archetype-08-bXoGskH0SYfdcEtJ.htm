<p>You can guide your crop to move without notice. When you and any of your crop are Avoiding Notice, you can choose one member of your crop to temporarily gain the benefits of the Quiet Allies skill feat until the group is no longer Avoiding Notice. The group rolls two checks instead of one, using the higher die roll. This is a fortune effect.</p>
