<hr />
<p>The blessing of your deity heightens your healing ability, making your mundane healing work as if by magic.</p>
<p>When you succeed at a Medicine check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.1kGNdIIhuglAjIp9]{Treat Wounds}, your action gains the divine trait and you heal the maximum amount for the 2d8 (or 4d8 on a critical success). If you have an ability that adds additional dice to your Treat Wounds, you still roll those normally.</p>
