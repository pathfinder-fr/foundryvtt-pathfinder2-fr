<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An ally within 30 feet @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Casts a Spell}.</p>
<hr>
<p>You use your performances to supplement an ally's spellcasting, providing magical energy for their spells.</p>
<p>Attempt a Performance check, using a very high DC for the ally's level (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 503–504), and either spend a Focus Point (if the triggering spell is a focus spell) or expend a spell slot at least 1 level higher than the triggering spell. If you succeed at the Performance check, your ally's spell doesn't cost the Focus Point or spell slot.</p>
