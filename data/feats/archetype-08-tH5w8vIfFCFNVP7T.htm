<p>You can invoke the Crimson Oath to unleash blasts of ruby energy from your weapon. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.AsKLseOo8hwv5Jha]{Invoke the Crimson Oath} focus spell. If you don’t already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the Refocus activity to recite the Crimson Oath and meditate on its teachings; if you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your knight reclaimant focus spells are divine spells; when you gain this feat, you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs.&nbsp;</p>
