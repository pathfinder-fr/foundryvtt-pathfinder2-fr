------ Description (en) ------
<p>The fire inside you asserts itself as beaming, radiant light. Your body is naturally luminescent, glowing with the effects of a primal @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.WBmvzNDfpwka3qT4]{Light} cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. The light is involuntary and constant; if counteracted, it returns in [[/r 1d4]] rounds. You suffer a –2 circumstance penalty on Stealth checks to Hide or Sneak and gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saves against light effects and effects that inflict the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} conditions.</p>
