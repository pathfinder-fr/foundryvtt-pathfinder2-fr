------ Description (en) ------
<p>You’re exceptionally difficult to kill. The DC of your recovery checks is equal to 9 + your dying value, or 8 + your dying value if you have the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.AmP0qu7c5dlBSath]{Toughness} general feat.</p>
<p>In addition, whenever someone returns you to life using magic that would normally leave you debilitated for a week (such as raise dead or the resurrect ritual), you don’t suffer that condition.</p>
