------ Description (en) ------
<p>You can redirect a spell's power through you to deliver it within striking distance. If your next action is to Cast a Spell with 1 or more targets and a range farther than touch, you can change the range to touch. If the altered spell requires a spell attack roll, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack. This only allows you to touch a single target with the spell, even if the spell originally affected more than 1 target. After you Cast the Spell, you can Disarm, Shove, Trip, or Strike the target with an unarmed attack.</p>
