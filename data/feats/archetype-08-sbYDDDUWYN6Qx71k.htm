Name: Crude Communication
Nom: 
État: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Even if you don't speak a creature's language, you can rely on inflection, root words, and body language to infer rudimentary meaning.</p>
<p>If you interact with a creature for at least 10 minutes and that creature can speak a language, the GM rolls a secret Society check with a DC appropriate for the language's rarity.</p>
<p>On a success, you understand the gist of the meaning and can communicate basic concepts back to the creature; on a failure, you are mistaken or communicate incorrect concepts.</p>
<p>If you're legendary in Society, you can communicate instantly without needing to attempt a Society check; even if you didn't know the medium of communication the creature uses (speech, sign language, and so on), you intuit this information as soon as they try to communicate.</p>
