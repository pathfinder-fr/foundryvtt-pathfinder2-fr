<p>You know more about the habits of devils than is entirely safe. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks against <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=30">devils</a> and saving throws against their abilities. In addition, whenever you meet a devil in a social situation, you can immediately attempt a <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=6">Diplomacy</a> check to Make an Impression on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a –5 penalty to the check. If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.<br><br><strong>Special</strong> If you have the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=787">Glad-Hand</a> skill feat, you don’t take the penalty to your immediate Diplomacy check if the target is a devil.&nbsp;</p>
