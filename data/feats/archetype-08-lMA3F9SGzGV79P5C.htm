------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have a creature @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.VcDeM8A5oI6VqhbM]{Restrained}.</p>
<hr />
<p>You twist and squeeze the breath out of your foe. Make an unarmed melee Strike against the creature you have grabbed or restrained. On a success, you gain a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice and the target can barely speak until the start of your next turn or until it Escapes, whichever comes first. While it can barely speak, the target can't vocalize above a hoarse whisper, and it must succeed at a <span data-pf2-check="flat" data-pf2-traits="" data-pf2-label="Strangle DC" data-pf2-dc="10" data-pf2-show-dc="owner">Flat Check</span> or lose any action that requires speech, For an action requiring speech that is also a manipulate action, like Casting a Spell with somatic and verbal components, the target just rolls a single <span data-pf2-check="flat" data-pf2-traits="" data-pf2-label="Strangle DC" data-pf2-dc="10" data-pf2-show-dc="owner">Flat Check</span>, rather than an additional <span data-pf2-check="flat" data-pf2-traits="" data-pf2-label="Strangle DC" data-pf2-dc="5" data-pf2-show-dc="owner">Flat Check</span> for being grabbed.</p>
