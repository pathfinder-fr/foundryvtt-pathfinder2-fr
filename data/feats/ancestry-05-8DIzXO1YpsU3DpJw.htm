<p>Your expertise makes your snares more powerful, and you can place them quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Each day during your daily preparations, you can prepare three snares from your formula book for quick deployment; if the snare normally takes 1 minute to <a class="entity-link" data-pack="pf2e.actionspf2e" data-id="rmwa3OyhTZ2i2AHl" draggable="true"><i class="fas fa-suitcase"></i> Craft</a>, you can Craft it with 3 Interact actions. Snares prepared in this way don't cost you any resources to Craft. The number of snares you can prepare this way increases to four if you are a master in Crafting, and to five if you are legendary.</p>
<p>When you Craft and deploy a snare that deals damage, any creature that critically fails its saving throw against the snare's initial effect and takes damage becomes flat-footed until the end of its next turn.</p>
