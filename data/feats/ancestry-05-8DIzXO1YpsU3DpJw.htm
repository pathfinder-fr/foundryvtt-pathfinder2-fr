<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>expert in Crafting, @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.DMetdzt1VJL2Y62i]{Snare Crafting}</p>
<hr />
<p>Your expertise makes your snares more powerful, and you can place them quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Each day during your daily preparations, you can prepare three snares from your formula book for quick deployment; if the snare normally takes 1 minute to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.rmwa3OyhTZ2i2AHl]{Craft}, you can Craft it with 3 Interact actions. Snares prepared in this way don&rsquo;t cost you any resources to Craft. The number of snares you can prepare this way increases to four if you are a master in Crafting, and to five if you are legendary.</p>
<p>When you Craft and deploy a snare that deals damage, any creature that critically fails its saving throw against the snare&rsquo;s initial effect and takes damage becomes flat-footed until the end of its next turn.</p>
