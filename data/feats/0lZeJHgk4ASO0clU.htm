<p>You’ve sworn to slay evil dragons. Add the following tenet to your code after the others: “You must slay evil dragons you encounter as long as you have a reasonable chance of success. Your Retributive Strike gains a +4 circumstance bonus to damage against an evil dragon, or +6 if you have master proficiency with the weapon you used. Your Glimpse of Redemption’s resistance against damage from an evil dragon is 7 + your level. If you use Liberating Step triggered by an evil dragon, your ally gains a +4 circumstance bonus to checks granted by your Liberating Step, and the ally can Step twice afterward. You don’t consider evil dragons to be legitimate authorities, even in nations they rule.</p>
