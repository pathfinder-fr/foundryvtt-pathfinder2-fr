<hr>
<p>When you are in your social identity, you can also grant a social identity to an animal companion, familiar, or other minion you gained from a class feature.</p>
<p>When changing to your social identity, you also change your minion’s appearance to that of a socially acceptable creature of its type, such as grooming a wolf to appear as a large dog or disguising a familiar to appear as an exotic pet.</p>
<p>Commanding your minion to use unusual magical or combat abilities it gained from your class features or feats while in this social identity risks exposing your vigilante identity.</p>
