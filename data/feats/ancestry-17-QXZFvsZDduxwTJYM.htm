<p>Your people used powerful magic to travel between distant worlds, and the remnants of that magic make such transportation easier for you.</p>
<p>When you are the target of a teleportation spell that transports more than one person, it can affect an additional person beyond the normal limit, chosen by the caster.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you're the target of a @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.69L70wKfGDY66Mk9]{Teleport} spell, you and the other targets arrive no farther than 1 mile off target, regardless of distance traveled.</p>
