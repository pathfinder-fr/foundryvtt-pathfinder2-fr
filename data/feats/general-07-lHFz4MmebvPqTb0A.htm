<hr>
<p>You can predict which consumables you might need in advance. When using Prescient Planner, you can procure a consumable item from your backpack, instead of a piece of adventuring gear. The consumable item must still be common with a level no higher than half your level, and its Bulk must be low enough that carrying it wouldn't have made you encumbered.</p>
