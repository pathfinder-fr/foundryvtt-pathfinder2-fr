------ Description (en) ------
<p>You can prepare two spells in one slot, giving you the freedom to choose the spell when you cast it.</p>
<p>When you prepare your spells for the day, you can choose one spell slot at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast and prepare two spells in that slot.</p>
<p>When you <a class="entity-link" data-pack="pf2e.actionspf2e" data-id="aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz" draggable="true"><i class="fas fa-suitcase"></i> Cast a Spell</a> from that slot, choose which spell to cast. Once you've chosen, the unused spell dissipates as though you hadn't prepared it at all—for example, it isn't available for use with <a class="entity-link" data-pack="pf2e.actionspf2e" data-id="v82XtjAVN4ffgVVR" draggable="true"><i class="fas fa-suitcase"></i> Drain Bonded Item</a>.</p>
