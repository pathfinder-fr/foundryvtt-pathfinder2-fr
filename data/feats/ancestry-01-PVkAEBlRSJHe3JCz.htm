------ Description (en) ------
<p>You descend from one of the truly ancient vampires, a nosferatu cursed to eternal life but not eternal youth. People call you straveika, or ancient-born. The vestiges of your forebear's powers of domination have left you with an understanding of how a creature's intentions change its behaviors. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.1xRFPTFtWtGJ9ELw]{Sense Motive} and Perception DCs against attempts to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.ewwCglB7XOPLUz72]{Lie} to you.</p>
