------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your tricks discombobulate your opponent, leaving spots in their vision from the bright flash of your gunshot reflected straight into their eyes (or other visual organs). Attempt a Performance check against the target creature's Will DC and make a ranged firearm Strike against that target. If the Strike deals damage to the target creature and you succeed at the Performance check, the creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} for 1 round.</p>
