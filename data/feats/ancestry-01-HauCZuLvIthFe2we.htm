------ Description (en) ------
<p>You have an affect that dragonkind find unusually pleasing—and when that fails, you know when to duck. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks and saving throws against dragons. In addition, whenever you meet a creature with the dragon trait in a social situation, you can attempt a Diplomacy check to Make an Impression on that creature immediately, rather than after conversing for 1 minute; you take a –5 penalty to this check. If you fail, you can choose to engage in 1 minute of conversation and then attempt a new check rather than accept the failure or critical failure result.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Special</strong> If you have the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.cc8O47KFsODReoBe]{Glad-Hand} skill feat, you don’t take the penalty to your immediate Diplomacy check if the target has the dragon trait.</p>
