------ Description (en) ------
<p>A combination of additional viscosity and careful application keeps your weapons poisoned even when suffering significant wear and tear.</p>
<p>If your @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strike} with a poisoned weapon would expend its poison without your target attempting an initial save (due to resistance or your Strike being a critical failure, for example), attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a success, your weapon remains poisoned.</p>
<p>If your Strike with a poisoned weapon succeeds, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, your weapon remains poisoned until the end of your next turn.</p>
