<hr>
<p>Identifying a creature is the first step in finding its weaknesses. Attempt a Strike against the target; if successful, you deal an additional <a class="inline-roll roll" title="precision" data-mode="roll" data-flavor="precision" data-formula="1d6"> 1d6</a> precision damage. If you have succeeded on a Recall Knowledge check against the target during this combat and their creature type was previously recorded using <a class="entity-link" draggable="true" data-pack="pf2e.feats-srd" data-id="0Dy8RlFqrzCVOTl4"> Thorough Reports</a>, you also deal <a class="inline-roll roll" title="persistent bleed" data-mode="roll" data-flavor="persistent bleed" data-formula="1"> 1</a> point of persistent bleed damage. The creature is then temporarily immune to Discerning Strike for 1 day.</p>
