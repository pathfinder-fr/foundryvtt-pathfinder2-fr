------ Description (en) ------
<p>You can take 10 minutes to emblazon @Compendium[pf2e.deities.QZD0u1jxwz0kj8uI]{Pharasma's} holy sigil-a spiraling comet that represents the winding path a soul takes through its existence-upon a shield, tabard, banner, or other prominent object that your wear or wield. The symbol doesn't fade until 1 year has passed, but if you emblazon the symbol again, any symbol you previously emblazoned and any symbol already emblazoned on that item instantly disappears. The item becomes a religious symbol of Pharasma and can be used as a divine focus while emblazoned.</p>
<p>Whenever an undead creature or captive soul is within 100 feet of this object, the spiral glows, shedding dim blue light in a 10-foot radius. If the creature is hiding or the soul is hidden, it must succeed at a @Check[type:stealth|dc:resolve(10+@actor.attributes.perception.value)] check against your Perception DC to fool the sigil and prevent the spiral from glowing.</p>
<p>In addition, you can cast <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.kcelf6IHl3L9VXXg]{Disrupt Undead}</em> as a divine innate cantrip at will. As normal, a cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity if you didn't have it already. You're trained in divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Wisdom.</p>
<p>When you have at least two other feats from this archetype, the spiral glows with bright light in a 10-foot radius (and dim light for the next 10 feet). Feats that require a creature or object to be in the light of your spiral function whether it's in the bright or dim light.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the soul warden archetype.</p>
