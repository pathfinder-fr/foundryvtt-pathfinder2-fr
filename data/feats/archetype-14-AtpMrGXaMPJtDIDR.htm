<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.UuPZ7drPBnSmI8Eo]{Red Mantis Assassin Dedication}</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are wielding a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.wkzxLpSe7LN6c5Ld]{Sawtooth Saber} in each hand.</p>
<hr>
<p>You've mastered the signature assassination style of the Red Mantis. Attempt to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.QNAVeNKtHA0EUw4X]{Feint} an enemy within 30 feet. If your Feint is successful, when you use Prayer Attack on subsequent turns you automatically make the target flat-footed against your melee attacks for that turn without rolling a check to Feint, so as long as you remain visible to the target and the target remains within 30 feet of you. If you use your Prayer Attack against a different target, you must attempt to Feint the target normally.</p>
<p>When you use Prayer Attack, your next successful Strike with a sawtooth saber that turn deals 2d6 persistent bleed damage to the target.</p>
