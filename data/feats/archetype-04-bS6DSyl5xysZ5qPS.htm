------ Description (en) ------
<p>You gain your mystery's initial revelation spell (@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.AspA30tzKCHFWRf0]{Incendiary Aura}). Casting this spell progresses your @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ibX2EhKkyUtbOHLj]{Oracular Curse}. Use the minor curse from your mystery, but when you progress it again, instead of your mystery's moderate curse effect, you become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} in addition to the effects of the minor curse.</p>
<p>If you don't have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Refocus} by reconciling the conflicting nature of your mystery, which also reduces your curse to minor.</p>
<h4>Minor Curse of Flames</h4>
<p>The smoke, heat, and crackling flames of your curse fill your vision and all your other senses.</p>
<p>Creatures further than 30 feet are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} from you. You can't benefit from effects that would allow you to ignore or mitigate this concealment, as normal for effects of an oracular curse.</p>
