<hr>
<p>Your tattoos are a work of eldritch genius, a masterpiece of art, magic, and skin. Choose a 3rd-level <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?Tradition=1">arcane</a> spell from the same school as your Arcane Tattoos, either a common spell or another to which you have access, including a lower-level spell heightened to 3rd level if you wish. You can cast that spell once per day as an innate arcane spell.&nbsp;</p>
