<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>trained in Society</p>
<hr>
<p>You are adept at quickly scanning loose papers and carefully discerning the contents of sealed letters without damaging the seal.</p>
<p>You can attempt Society checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.d9gbpiQjChYDYA2L]{Decipher Writing} on a message that is only partially glimpsed, upside down or reversed from your perspective, or even sealed. However, on a critical failure, the recipient is made aware of your efforts (for instance, you damage the seal or disturb the papers in some way).</p>
<p>When using this feat to decipher sealed letters, your attempt to Decipher Writing gains the manipulate trait.</p>
<p>This feat doesn't prevent witnesses from noticing your efforts, particularly with sealed letters which you must manipulate directly in order to read; you might need to attempt Deception or Stealth checks to avoid being noticed.</p>
