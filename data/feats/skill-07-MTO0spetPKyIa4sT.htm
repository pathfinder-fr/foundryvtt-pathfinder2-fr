<p>Experience and training have taught you that water has just enough surface tension for a master sprinter to traverse the surface.</p>
<p>When you @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Bcxarzksqt9ezrs6]{Stride} in a straight line, if you move at least half your Speed over ground, you can move any amount of the remaining distance across a level body of water. If you don't end your Stride on solid ground, you fall into the water.</p>
<p>If you're legendary in Athletics, as long as you start on solid ground, any part of your Stride can cross the water's surface, even if you aren't moving a straight line, though you still fall into the water if you don't end your movement on solid ground.</p>
