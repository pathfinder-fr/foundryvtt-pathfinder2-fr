------ Description (en) ------
<p>During your daily preparations, you find medicinal plants endemic to your location. Until your next preparations, you can spend an additional batch of herbs to add a benefit to an item you create with your herbalism.</p>
<p>The benefit of the special herbs affects the creature that the item is applied to; if the benefit is not immediate, it lasts for 1 minute unless otherwise stated. This adjustment counts as an additive (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 75), so you can't include another additive without spoiling the item.</p>
