------ Description (en) ------
<p>The sheer power of your attacks, or the overwhelming number of them, leaves an enemy flustered. If you critically hit your hunted prey with a ranged weapon, or hit it at least twice on the same turn with a ranged weapon, it’s flat-footed until the start of your next turn.</p>
