<hr>
<p>You use the power of your Rain-Scribe magic to draw on a stream of primal power for sustenance. You don’t need to eat or drink and need only 6 hours of rest to feel well rested. You must still rest at least 8 hours and spend 1 hour of preparation to regain resources usable only a limited number of times per day, such as spell slots.</p>
<p>You can draw on primal power to stay awake and alert while otherwise resting your body and mind, gaining the full benefits of an 8-hour rest without falling asleep. When you do, you lose the other benefits of Rain- Scribe Sustenance for 1 week while your primal energies recharge.&nbsp;</p>
