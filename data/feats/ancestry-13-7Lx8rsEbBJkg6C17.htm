------ Description (en) ------
<p>You can share your power with others, but they can’t escape the werecreature’s curse as easily as you can. You can cast a 5th-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.YtesyvfAIwXOqISq]{Moon Frenzy}&nbsp;as a primal innate spell once per day. At 15th level, you cast a 6th-level <em>moon frenzy</em> instead. At 17th level, your 6th-level <em>moon frenzy</em> grants its standard effects, except the temporary Hit Points increase to 15 and the silver weakness increases to 15. At 20th level, you cast a 10th-level <em>moon frenzy</em> instead. The spell uses your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.</p>
