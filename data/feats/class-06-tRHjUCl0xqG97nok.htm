Nom: 
État: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>You adopt a stance designed to rebound your thrown weapons back toward you. While you are in this stance, any thrown weapons you use as part of a ranged @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strike} to deal bludgeoning or slashing damage immediately return to your hand, enabling you to use them for additional Strikes.</p>
<p>You must be within the weapon’s listed range increment and have a hand free to catch the weapon. If you make a ranged Strike with a thrown weapon outside of its listed range increment, it instead flies back toward you a number of feet equal to its listed range increment and then falls to the ground.</p>
