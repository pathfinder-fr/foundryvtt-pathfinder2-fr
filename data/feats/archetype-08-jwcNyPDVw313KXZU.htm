<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are wearing medium armor or heavier.</p>
<hr>
<p>You rebuff puny attacks with your armor, knocking back your foe. Attempt an Athletics check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.7blmbDrQFNfdT731]{Shove} the triggering foe, even if you don't have a hand free. If you succeed, you can't @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Bcxarzksqt9ezrs6]{Stride} to follow the foe, as you're knocking the foe back with the rebounded attack, not by physically moving towards them.</p>
