<p>Thousands of years ago, your ancestors made a pact with @Compendium[pf2e.deities.ZfN7jkK6boU1FuiS]{Zon-Kuthon}. He has not forgotten, even if you might wish he had. You can take 1 damage to mix blood and shadows to cast 5th-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.TUj8eugNqAvB1vVR]{Creation} as an innate divine spell. You can use this ability as often as you wish, but you can have only one such object in existence at a time. If the object encounters bright light, the spell ends and the object dissolves into shadows.&nbsp;</p>
