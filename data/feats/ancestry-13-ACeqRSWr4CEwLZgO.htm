<hr>
<p>Thousands of years ago, your ancestors made a pact with <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=20">Zon-Kuthon</a>. He has not forgotten, even if you might wish he had. You can take 1 damage to mix blood and shadows to cast 5th-level <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=54"><em>creation</em></a> as an innate divine spell. You can use this ability as often as you wish, but you can have only one such object in existence at a time. If the object encounters bright light, the spell ends and the object dissolves into shadows.&nbsp;</p>
