<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.YhnCjiHNlS3nCeoC]{Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication}</p>
<hr>
<p>When you lash out with both weapons, you leave no room for the target to escape your attack.</p>
<p>When you use @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.onde0SxLoxLBTnvm]{Double Slice}, if you miss with both @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strikes}, choose one of the two weapons and apply the effects of a hit with that weapon.</p>
<p>You can’t choose a weapon if your attack roll with that weapon was a critical failure, meaning you still miss entirely if both attack rolls were critical failures.</p>
