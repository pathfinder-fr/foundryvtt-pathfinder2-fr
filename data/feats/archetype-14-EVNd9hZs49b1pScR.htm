------ Description (en) ------
<p>When you lash out with both weapons, you leave no room for the target to escape your attack.</p>
<p>When you use <a class="entity-link" data-pack="pf2e.feats-srd" data-id="onde0SxLoxLBTnvm" draggable="true"> Double Slice</a>, if you miss with both <a class="entity-link" data-pack="pf2e.actionspf2e" data-id="VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR" draggable="true"> Strikes</a>, choose one of the two weapons and apply the effects of a hit with that weapon.</p>
<p>You can't choose a weapon if your attack roll with that weapon was a critical failure, meaning you still miss entirely if both attack rolls were critical failures.</p>
