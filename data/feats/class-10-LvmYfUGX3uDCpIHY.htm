------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are wearing your armor innovation. You electrify your armor to punish foes who dare to attack you. For 1 round, any creature that touches you, or that hits you with a melee unarmed attack or a non-reach melee weapon attack, takes [[/r {1d4}[electricity]]]{1d4 electricity damage}. The effect ends if you cease wearing your armor innovation.</p>
<p>If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, the damage increases to [[/r 2d4]]{2d4}.</p>
<p><strong>Unstable Function</strong> You create an unstable chain reaction, sending countless sparks dancing across your armor. Add the unstable trait to Electrify Armor. The effects last for 1 minute instead of 1 round, and the damage dice increase from d4s to d12s.</p>
