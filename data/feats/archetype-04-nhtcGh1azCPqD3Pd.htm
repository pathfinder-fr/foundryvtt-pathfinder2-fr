------ Description (en) ------
<p>You gain your mystery's initial revelation spell (@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.d2pi7laQkzlr3wrS]{Ancestral Touch}). Casting this spell progresses your @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ibX2EhKkyUtbOHLj]{Oracular Curse}. Use the minor curse from your mystery, but when you progress it again, instead of your mystery's moderate curse effect, you become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} in addition to the effects of the minor curse.</p>
<p>If you don't have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Refocus} by reconciling the conflicting nature of your mystery, which also reduces your curse to minor.</p>
<h4>Minor Curse of Ancestors</h4>
<p>One of your ancestors becomes predominant in their meddling. The first time you gain this effect each day, roll [[/r 1d4]] on the list below to determine which type of ancestor becomes predominant. This predominant ancestor guides you to use their preferred type of action.</p>
<p>When you try to use one of the types of actions listed for the other ancestors, you must succeed at a <span data-pf2-check="flat" data-pf2-dc="4">DC 4 flat check</span>. On a failure, you spend the action but gain no effect (though you don't lose the spell if you were Casting a Spell). If your action would take 1 minute or longer, it's long enough that you can overcome the meddling, and you don't need to attempt a flat check.</p>
<p>During combat or another tense, round-by-round encounter, other ancestors wrestle for control of your actions. When you roll initiative, and then at the end of each of your turns during the encounter, roll [[/r 1d4]] and change your predominant ancestor appropriately. Once the encounter ends, you return to the influence of the ancestor you first rolled for the day.</p>
