------ Description (en) ------
<p>Negative energy intensifies your undead form and makes your very touch the antithesis of life. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.ancestryfeatures.YGk41WV42aTM7CQV]{Advanced Undead Benefits} The damage die for your fist increases to 1d6 instead of 1d4, it deals negative damage instead of bludgeoning damage, and it loses the nonlethal trait. Your fist becomes magical.</p>
<p>When you critically hit a living creature with your fist Strike, the creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} until the end of your next turn unless it succeeds at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.spellDC.value)] save against your spell DC. This is a critical specialization effect.</p>
