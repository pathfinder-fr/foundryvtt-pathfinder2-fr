<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You would gain the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.HL2l2VRSaQHu9lUw]{Fatigued} condition.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.1wQY3JYyhMYeeV2G]{Observed} by at least three creatures <br>who aren't foes.</p>
<hr>
<p>As long as you have an audience, you can continue to perform. Indeed, you must-you have an obligation to your fans!</p>
<p>You delay the effects of the fatigued condition for 1 minute or until you are no longer observed by the required creatures, whichever comes first. If the fatigued condition has a duration, the duration begins to elapse only after the delay. You can't further delay or prevent the fatigued condition after this ability ends.</p>
