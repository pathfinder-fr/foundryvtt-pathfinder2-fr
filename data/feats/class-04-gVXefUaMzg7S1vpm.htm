------ Description (en) ------
<p>You attack carefully to knock some sense into a creature whose actions aren't their own. Make a Strike against a @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.yblD8fOR1J8rDwEQ]{Confused} ally. The Strike is nonlethal and doesn't take a -2 penalty for using a weapon without the nonlethal trait; if you hit and deal damage, your ally automatically succeeds at the flat check to remove the confused condition when taking damage.</p>
