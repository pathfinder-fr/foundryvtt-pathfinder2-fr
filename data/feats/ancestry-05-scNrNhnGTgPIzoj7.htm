------ Description (en) ------
<p>Long-lived elves have seen civilizations rise and fall, often at the hands of outside forces. As a result, they have developed a wariness of others who might seek to influence or control them.</p>
<p>You've been trained to resist such manipulation, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that would make you controlled, such as @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.OsOhx3TGIZ7AhD0P]{Dominate}, and to Perception checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.1xRFPTFtWtGJ9ELw]{Sense Motive} when trying to determine if a creature is under the influence of such an effect.</p>
<p>When you roll a success on a saving throw against such an effect, you get a critical success instead.</p>
