------ Description (en) ------
<p>Using your ancestors' bones, you manifest their spirits around you in a fossilized form, terrifying your foes. You can cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.O6VQC1Bs4aSYDa6R]{Mask of Terror} on yourself as a primal innate spell once per day. When you do, you appear as a skeletal lizardfolk ancestor, twisted in a way that inspires the deepest fears of those who observe you.</p>
