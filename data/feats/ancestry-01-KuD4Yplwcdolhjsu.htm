<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Many consider half-orcs little more than dumb brutes. This is offensive to you, but it can occasionally be useful. You are trained in <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=5">Deception</a> (or another skill of your choice if you were already trained in Deception), and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Lie when specifically claiming ignorance and to Deception DCs against <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=85">Sense Motive</a> checks to uncover such lies.&nbsp;</span></p>
