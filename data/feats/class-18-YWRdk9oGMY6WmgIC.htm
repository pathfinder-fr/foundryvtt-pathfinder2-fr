<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.264KzmKMK4zqi6AR]{Clue Them All In}</p>
<hr>
<p>You spend 1 minute briefing up to four allies about one lead you're pursuing.</p>
<p>Those allies gain the same circumstance bonus you do from @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.xTK2zsWFyxSJvYbX]{Pursue a Lead} to checks to investigate that lead. This bonus lasts until you cease pursing that lead or for 1 day, whichever comes first. This doesn't confer any other benefits of pursuing a lead, such as adding the circumstance bonus to your saves with @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.5cYFHKQK6OZCwavI]{Detective's Readiness}.</p>
