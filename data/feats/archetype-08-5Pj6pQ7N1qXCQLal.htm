------ Description (en) ------
<p>You've learned to harness the supernatural curse that animates you, imbuing your most powerful attacks with a terrible curse. When you critically hit with a fist Strike, negative energy binds to it; this is a curse and a disease. The creature takes [[/r {2d6}[persistent,negative]]] @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent negative Damage}. While the creature has this persistent damage, it's also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 1}. The persistent damage increases to 3d6 at 14th level and 4d6 at 20th level. This is a critical specialization effect.</p>
