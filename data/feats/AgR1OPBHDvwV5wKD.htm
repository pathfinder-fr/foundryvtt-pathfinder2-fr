<hr>
<p>Your supernatural connection sometimes causes you to phase from reality when under threat, disappearing for split seconds before reappearing—often surprising you as much as your enemies. Roll a DC 16 flat check. On a success, you gain resistance to all damage equal to your level against the triggering effect, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against that effect until the start of your turn, and you gain the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=7">dazzled</a> condition for 1 round.&nbsp;</p>
