<p>You pour negative energy into toxins you create to further debilitate your targets. When you <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=43">Craft</a> an alchemical poison (rather than create it with advanced alchemy, Quick Alchemy, or another means), it becomes a blessed alchemical poison and gains the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=118">negative</a> trait. When a creature is afflicted with a blessed alchemical poison, for 1 round, any Hit Points it would regain from a positive effect are reduced by 5, or by 10 if you are legendary in <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=4">Crafting</a>.&nbsp;</p>
