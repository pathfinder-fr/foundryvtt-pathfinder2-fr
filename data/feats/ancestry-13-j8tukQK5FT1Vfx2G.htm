------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Access</strong> You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You misfire with a firearm or you roll a failure on a Strike with a ranged weapon.</p>
<hr />
<p>You sense a minor flaw in the weapon as you fire it, and quickly adjust your aim on the fly to avoid the flaw. If the triggering Strike was a misfire, you get a normal failure instead. If the triggering Strike was a failure, it becomes a glancing blow that deals minimum damage for the Strike (adding any bonuses as normal but getting a result of 1 for all damage dice that would be rolled on a success). The glancing blow does not apply other effects that would normally happen only on a hit.</p>
