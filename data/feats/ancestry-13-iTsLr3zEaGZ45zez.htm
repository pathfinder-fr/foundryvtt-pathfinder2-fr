<hr>
<p>Even other halflings consider you to be particularly lucky. You can use Halfling Luck once per hour, rather than once per day. If you have @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.k0sXAn4PPq5nW9al]{Guiding Luck}, you can still use Halfling Luck when you fail a Perception check or attack roll only once per day (though you can use it within the same hour that you used Halfling Luck), and if you have @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.gWyCNTWUhxneOBne]{Helpful Halfling}, you can still use Halfling Luck on an ally instead of yourself only once per day.&nbsp;</p>
