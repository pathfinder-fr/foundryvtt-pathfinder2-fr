------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You're about to roll initiative.</p>
<hr>
<p>You allow your foes to make the first move in a show of incredible confidence. You don't roll initiative; instead you voluntarily go last. You gain @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.LzYi0OuOoypNb6jd]{Panache}.</p>
<p>If more than one character uses this ability or another ability to go last, use the normal rules for resolving a tie: NPCs and monsters act before PCs, and within those groups, the creatures can choose whichever order they want.</p>
