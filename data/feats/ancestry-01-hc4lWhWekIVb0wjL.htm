------ Description (en) ------
<p>Years of packing for travel have taught you how to cram vast quantities into small spaces. You can fit an additional 50% of the listed Bulk capacity into mundane storage containers or vehicles.</p>
<p>For example, you can fit 6 Bulk in a backpack, or 12 Bulk in a chest. This doesn’t alter the items’ Bulk, nor does it change how much you can store in a magical or extradimensional storage space, such as a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.jaEEvuQ32GjAa8jy]{Bag of Holding}.</p>
