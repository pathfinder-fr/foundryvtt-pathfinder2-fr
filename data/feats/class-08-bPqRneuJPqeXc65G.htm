<hr>
<p>The presence of goodness sickens you with its saccharine self-righteousness. When in the presence of an aura of good that is powerful or overwhelming (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 328), you detect the aura, though you might not do so instantly, and you can't pinpoint the location. This acts as a vague sense, similar to humans' sense of smell.</p>
<p>A good creature using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence attempts a Deception check against your Perception DC to hide its aura from you. If the creature succeeds at its Deception check, it is then temporarily immune to your Sense Good for 1 day.</p>
