<p>You forge strong connections with animals. You can spend 7 days of downtime trying to bond with a normal animal (not a companion or other special animal). After this duration, attempt a DC 20 Nature check. If successful, you bond with the animal. The animal is permanently helpful to you, unless you do something egregious to break your bond. A helpful animal is easier to direct, as described under Command an Animal on page 249. Bonding with a new animal ends any previous bond you had. You can’t have both a bonded animal and an animal companion (though you can have both a bonded animal and a familiar).</p>
