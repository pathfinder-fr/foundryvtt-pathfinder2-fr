<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>trained in Deception</p>
<hr>
<p>You enter a seemingly unfocused stance that mimics the movements of the inebriated—bobbing, weaving, leaving false openings, and distracting your enemies from your true movements.</p>
<p>While in this stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.QNAVeNKtHA0EUw4X]{Feint}. The only @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strikes} you can make are stumbling swing unarmed attacks. These deal [[/r 1d8 #bludgeoning]] bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.</p>
<p>If an enemy hits you with a melee Strike while in this stance, it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} against the next stumbling swing Strike you make against it before the end of your next turn.</p>
