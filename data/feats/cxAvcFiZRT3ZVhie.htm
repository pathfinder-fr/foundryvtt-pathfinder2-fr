<p>You use Emerald Bough techniques to create a small extradimensional space called a hideaway that lasts as long as you are conscious. The hideaway functions as a <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=249"><em>type I bag of holding</em></a>, but has no Bulk and takes no hands; it holds one object with a maximum Bulk equal to your highest mental ability score modifier; as you open the hideaway with pure thought, activating it to retrieve an item is a free action with the envision component instead of a single action with the Interact component. The hideaway’s access point appears as an obviously magical gap within 1 foot of your body. Only you can access the hideaway; you can you use an Interact action each round to physically hold it open for another person. A successful <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=78"><em>dispel magic</em></a> spell or similar effect against your spell DC and the hideaway’s counteract level of 2 expels the object; the object is also expelled if you become unconscious. After a successful <em>dispel magic </em>spell or when you become conscious again, the hideaway immediately reforms with no additional action from you. You can also dismiss the hideaway (if it is empty) or re-form it using a single action with the envision component.&nbsp;</p>
