<p>You can cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.qXTB7Ec9yYh5JPPV]{Purify Food and Drink} as a primal innate spell, but only on liquids. You can cast this spell once every 10 minutes. You can also use your innate purify food and drink on a touched creature instead of a liquid to purify their blood, giving that creature a +2 status bonus for 1 minute on their ongoing saves against poisons already present in their body when you cast the spell.</p>
