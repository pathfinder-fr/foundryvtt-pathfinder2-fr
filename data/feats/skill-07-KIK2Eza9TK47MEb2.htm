------ Description (en) ------
<p>You can downplay the consequences or outrageousness of your requests using sheer brazenness and charm. When you&nbsp;Request&nbsp;something, you reduce any DC increases for making an outrageous request by 2, and if you roll a critical failure for your&nbsp;Request, you get a failure instead. While this means you can never cause your target to reduce their attitude toward you by making a&nbsp;Request, they eventually tire of requests, even though they still have a positive attitude toward you.</p>
