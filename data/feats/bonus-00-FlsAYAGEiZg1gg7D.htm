------ Description (en) ------
<p>You channel disruptive power that severs a foe’s spiritual connection to their heretical magic. Make a melee Strike. If the attack hits, any time the target attempts to cast a divine or occult spell, the spell is disrupted unless they succeed at a DC 5 flat check (DC 7 on a critical hit); if the target is also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied}, it must attempt the harder of the two flat checks (but not both). This effect lasts for 1 minute.</p>
