<p>Your nanites fly out of your body, swarming around you in a cloud. You become concealed for a number of rounds equal to half your level. You can’t use this concealment to Hide or Sneak, as normal for concealment that makes your position obvious. While Nanite Shroud is active, you can’t use other abilities that require the use of your nanites.</p>
