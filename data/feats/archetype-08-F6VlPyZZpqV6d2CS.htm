------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> Your last action was a @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.onde0SxLoxLBTnvm]{Double Slice}, and both attacks hit the target.</p>
<hr>
<p>When you hit with both attacks with Double Slice, you flense the target, making it bleed and creating a weak spot.</p>
<p>The target takes [[/r 1d8 #persistent bleed]] persistent bleed damage per weapon damage die of whichever of the weapons you used that has the most weapon damage dice (maximum 4d8 for a <em>major striking</em> weapon).</p>
<p>The target becomes flat-footed, and its resistances to any physical damage types are reduced by 5; these two effects last until the beginning of your next turn.</p>
