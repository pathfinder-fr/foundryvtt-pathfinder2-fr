<p>With precisely the right words of encouragement, you bolster an ally's efforts.</p>
<p>Designate an ally within 30 feet; this action counts as sufficient preparation to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW]{Aid} that ally. When you use the Aid reaction to help that ally, you can roll Diplomacy in place of the usual check.</p>
<p>If your swashbuckler's style is wit and your Diplomacy check to Aid meets or exceeds the very hard DC for your level, you gain @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.LzYi0OuOoypNb6jd]{Panache}.</p>
