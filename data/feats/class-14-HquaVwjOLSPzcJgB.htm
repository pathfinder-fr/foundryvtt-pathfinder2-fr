<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Jtn7IugykXDlIoZq]{Opportune Riposte}</p>
<hr>
<p>Your ripostes can deflect attacks back at their source.</p>
<p>You can use Opportune Riposte with a trigger of “A foe outside of your reach critically fails an attack roll against you” in addition to its usual trigger.</p>
<p>When you use Opportune Riposte with this new trigger against a ranged attack, your @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strike} deflects some of the triggering effect back toward its source. Compare the result of your attack roll to the AC of the triggering foe. On a hit, you deal the normal amount of damage for your Strike, but the damage type changes to that of the triggering attack.</p>
<p>For instance, if you used Opportune Riposte to deflect a @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gYjPm7YwGtEa1oxh]{Ray of Frost}, your Strike would deal cold damage instead of its normal damage type.</p>
