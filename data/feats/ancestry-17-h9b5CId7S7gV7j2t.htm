<p>You have reconfigured the magical resonance of your core to attune to the planar energies of Axis. You can cast <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.5bTt2CvYHPvaR7QQ]{Plane Shift}</em> twice per week as an arcane innate spell that can only target yourself; you can travel only to Axis or the Material Plane, and your body serves as the focus component.</p>
