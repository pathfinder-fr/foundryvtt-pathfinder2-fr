<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within your eidolon's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.</p>
<p>Your eidolon makes a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, your eidolon disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.</p>
