------ Description (en) ------
<p>You've learned to create a limited number of snares at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you can prepare four snares from your formula book for quick deployment; if they normally take 1 minute to <a class="entity-link" data-pack="pf2e.actionspf2e" data-id="rmwa3OyhTZ2i2AHl" draggable="true"> Craft</a>, you can Craft them with 3 <a class="entity-link" data-pack="pf2e.actionspf2e" data-id="pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F" draggable="true"> Interact</a> actions. The number of snares increases to six if you're a master in Crafting and eight if you're legendary.</p>
<p>Snares prepared in this way don't cost you any resources to Craft.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> The feat counts as <a class="entity-link" data-pack="pf2e.feats-srd" data-id="0haS0qXR9xTYKoTG" draggable="true"> Snare Specialist</a> for the purpose of feat prerequisites. If you also have the Snare Specialist ranger feat, the <a class="entity-link" data-pack="pf2e.feats-srd" data-id="KW6K5Zv4J7ClWkKA" draggable="true"> Quick Snares</a> from both feats are cumulative. You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the snarecrafter archetype.</p>
