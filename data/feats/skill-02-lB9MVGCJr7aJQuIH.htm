<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>expert in Stealth</p>
<hr>
<p>You have learned techniques to adjust and modify your armor and movements to reduce the noise you make.</p>
<p>When you wear non-noisy armor with which you are trained, your penalty to Stealth checks is reduced by 1 (to a minimum penalty of 0). If you’re a master in Stealth, reduce the penalty by 2, and if you’re legendary, reduce the penalty by 3.</p>
<p>If your armor has the noisy trait, instead of reducing the penalty to Stealth checks, you ignore the effects of the noisy trait, enabling you to remove the penalty with a sufficient Strength score as normal.</p>
