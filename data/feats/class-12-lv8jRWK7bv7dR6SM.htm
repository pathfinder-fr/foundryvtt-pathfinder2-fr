------ Description (en) ------
<p>When you unleash electricity from your innovation, you can bounce it off obstacles, creating a field of electric death. When you use Megavolt, each time your line of electricity hits a solid barrier, such as a wall, it bounces off at an angle of your choice and continues until you have reached the full length of the line. Even if a creature is in the area from multiple bounces, it takes the damage only once.</p>
