<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.jM72TjJ965jocBV8]{Shield Block} causes your shield to break or be destroyed.</p>
<hr>
<p>You're used to your shield breaking in the middle of battle, and you're prepared to use a backup or any convenient nearby object to defend yourself.</p>
<p>You can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F]{Interact} to draw a shield on your person or an unattended shield within your reach. If there is an object within your reach that could serve as an improvised shield-for example, a table or chair-you can Interact to draw it with this feat. The GM determines if something can be used as an improvised shield.</p>
<p>Your new shield isn't raised until you use the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.xjGwis0uaC2305pm]{Raise a Shield} action, as normal.</p>
