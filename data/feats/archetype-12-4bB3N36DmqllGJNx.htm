<hr>
<p>You can save your shield from total destruction, even after a devastating attack. If a shield would be destroyed due to damage taken during your @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.jM72TjJ965jocBV8]{Shield Block}, the shield remains intact at 1 Hit Point instead.</p>
<p>Its construction is weakened until you take the time to repair it, preventing you from using Shield Salvation to save the same shield until your next preparations.</p>
