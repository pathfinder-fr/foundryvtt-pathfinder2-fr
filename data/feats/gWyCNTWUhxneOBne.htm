On a critical success to <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=75">Aid</a>, you grant your ally a +3 circumstance bonus if you have expert proficiency in the skill (rather than +2), and you grant your ally a +4 circumstance bonus if you have master proficiency (rather than +3). If you roll a critical failure on a check to Aid, you don’t give your ally a –1 circumstance penalty to their check.&nbsp;</span></p>
