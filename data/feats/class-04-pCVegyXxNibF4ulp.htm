------ Description (en) ------
<p>You embellish your spellcasting with entrancing flourishes and grand pronouncements, making it harder to identify or counter.</p>
<p>If the next action you use is to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell}, creatures with the ability to Cast that Spell don’t automatically know what the spell is.</p>
<p>In addition, creatures that witness your spellcasting take a –2 circumstance penalty to checks to identify the spell with @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.1OagaWtBpVXExToo]{Recall Knowledge} and checks to counteract the spell during its casting (such as with @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.EpBG4CFMNSZQx7vI]{Counterspell}).</p>
