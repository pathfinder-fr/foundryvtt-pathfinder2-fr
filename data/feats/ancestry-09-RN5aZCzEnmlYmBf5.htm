------ Description (en) ------
<p>When you use Crystalline Dust, you can spend one additional action to disperse the motes as a 10-foot-radius cloud centered on you instead of as haze; the activity gains the concentrate trait. All creatures within the cloud become concealed, and all creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it.</p>
