------ Description (en) ------
<p>You were born to a jiang-shi, one of the so-called hopping vampires found most often in Tian-Xia. Your parent had a supernatural obsession with counting small objects, which manifests in you as a preternatural gift for linguistics and mathematics. You are trained in Society and gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.0N8TtGSk5enoLBZ8]{Eye For Numbers} skill feat. If you would automatically become trained in Society (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.</p>
