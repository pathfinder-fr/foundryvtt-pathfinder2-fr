------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your eidolon has enhanced senses. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception, and can't be flanked except by creatures that are higher level than it.</p>
<p>It can see @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible} creatures and objects; they appear translucent and are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed}.</p>
<p>When your eidolon moves within 30 feet of an illusion that can be disbelieved, the GM rolls a secret check to disbelieve it, even if your eidolon didn't spend an action to Interact.</p>
