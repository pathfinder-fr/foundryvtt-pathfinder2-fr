<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput"><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication<br><strong>Trigger</strong> You fail, but don’t critically fail, an attempt to Disable a Device on a trap.<br></span></p>
<hr>
<p>You intentionally set off the trap, but you take special precautions to protect yourself and your allies from the trap’s effects. For the next 2 rounds, if the trap rolls a critical success on an attack roll, it gets a normal success instead, and if anyone rolls a critical failure on their saving throw against the trap, they get a normal failure instead.&nbsp;</p>
