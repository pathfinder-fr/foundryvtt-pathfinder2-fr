<hr>
<p>You intentionally set off the trap, but you take special precautions to protect yourself and your allies from the trap’s effects. For the next 2 rounds, if the trap rolls a critical success on an attack roll, it gets a normal success instead, and if anyone rolls a critical failure on their saving throw against the trap, they get a normal failure instead.&nbsp;</p>
