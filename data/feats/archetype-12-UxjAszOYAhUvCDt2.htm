------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your grasp has a supernatural quality to it, preventing your foes from easily escaping-with or without magical assistance. If a creature you have @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} attempts to use a teleportation spell or effect, it must succeed at a <span data-pf2-check="flat" data-pf2-dc="15" data-pf2-show-dc="owner">Flat Check</span> or the spell fails. If a creature you have grabbed attempts to Escape while under the effect of freedom of movement, it must succeed at a <span data-pf2-check="flat" data-pf2-dc="15" data-pf2-show-dc="owner">Flat Check</span> or be forced to roll the Escape attempt normally, rather than automatically succeeding.</p>
