<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Crafting</p>
<hr>
<p>Your training focused on Crafting one particular kind of item. Select one of the specialties listed on page 267; you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to Craft items of that type. If you are a master in Crafting, this bonus increases to +2. If it’s unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides. Some specialties might apply only partially. For example, if you were making a morningstar and had specialty in woodworking, the GM might give you half your bonus because the item requires both blacksmithing and woodworking.</p>
