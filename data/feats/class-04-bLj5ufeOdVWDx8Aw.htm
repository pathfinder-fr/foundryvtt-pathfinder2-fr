------ Description (en) ------
<p>Starlight shines in your sight, enhancing your perception and range.</p>
<p>When you make a ranged Strike while in Arcane Cascade stance, you lower the DC of your flat check to target a creature that's @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} from you. The DC is reduced to <span data-pf2-check="flat" data-pf2-dc="3">3</span> instead of 5 against a concealed creature and to <span data-pf2-check="flat" data-pf2-dc="9">9</span> instead of 11 against a hidden one.</p>
<p>When you cast shooting star and target a hidden creature, you don't have to attempt the flat check for targeting a hidden creature with a ranged Strike.</p>
