<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Asb0UsQqeATsxqFJ]{Courageous Assault}</p>
<hr>
<p>In the triumph of battle, you can share the glory with another ally.</p>
<p>When the ally you chose for Courageous Assault critically succeeds at the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strike} granted by that action, another ally affected by your @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.IAjvwqgiDr3qGYxY]{Inspire Courage} composition spell can immediately use a reaction to make a melee Strike.</p>
<p>Since the second ally wasn’t the ally you chose for Courageous Assault, this effect doesn’t continue to a third ally, even if the second ally also critically succeeds at their Strike.</p>
