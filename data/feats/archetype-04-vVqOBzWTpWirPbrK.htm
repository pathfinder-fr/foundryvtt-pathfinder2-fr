------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your devotion to discovering and hoarding abstruse truths borders on the fanatical, and you can bring this devotion to bear. You gain the cleric’s @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.hT4INKGtly4QY8KN]{Domain Initiate} feat but must select knowledge, secrecy, or truth as your domain. You cast that domain’s domain spell as a focus spell of the same tradition as your cantrip from Eldritch Researcher Dedication, and you Refocus by contemplating abstruse mysteries rather than praying to a god. When an ability would manifest a divine symbol—such as the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.aF7RiG7c8GzSQLYt]{Word of Truth} focus spell—it instead manifests as a strange shape unique to you that seems to defy geometry.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can take this feat up to three times, selecting a different domain each time.</p>
