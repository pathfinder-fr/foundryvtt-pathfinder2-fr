If you @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.1If9lLVoZdO8woVg]{Consume Flesh} while satiated, you become fully satiated. You stay fully satiated for 3 hours, after which you become satiated for 1 hour. If you're fully satiated when an ability would end your satiation, you cease being fully satiated but remain satiated. If you have @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.7GrACprIxZuarGDs]{Grave Strength}, you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed when fully satiated instead of a +5-foot status bonus for being satiated.</p>
