------ Description (en) ------
<p>You can attach a scroll to your weapon or <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.FNDq4NFSN0g2HKWO]{Handwraps of Mighty Blows}</em> to blend its spell into an attack, carefully folding it around a part of the weapon or sealing it to the weapon's surface. Attaching a scroll requires using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.UAaQk93a30nx0nYY]{Affix a Talisman} action. You can have only one scroll affixed to a weapon at a time, and you can't have both a talisman and scroll attached.</p>
<p>You can Cast the Spell from the scroll as part of a Spellstrike, assuming the spell is one you could normally use with Spellstrike. You can't Cast the Spell in any other way while it's affixed, though you can use Affix a Talisman again to remove the scroll and use it as a normal—if a bit crumpled-scroll.</p>
