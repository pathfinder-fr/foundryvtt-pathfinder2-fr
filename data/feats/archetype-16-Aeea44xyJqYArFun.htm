<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.uCElsebJ45ltmZMT]{Mature Beastmaster Companion}, you have multiple animal companions</p>
<hr>
<p>You can have up to two animal companions active at once. However, when you do, it’s slightly more difficult to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.q9nbyIF0PEBqMtYe]{Command} them. If you don’t Command either of your companions, one of the two (your choice) can still use 1 action on your turn to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Bcxarzksqt9ezrs6]{Stride} or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strike}, as per Mature Beastmaster Companion, but not both.</p>
<p>When you Command an Animal, either choose one of the companions to take 2 actions, as normal, or else both companions can take 1 action to Stride or Strike. Either way, you can’t Command an Animal to make either companion act again until your next turn.</p>
