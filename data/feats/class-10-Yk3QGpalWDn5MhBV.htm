<hr>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is dazed and can barely vocalize. It’s @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned} 1 and its speech is raspy and hard to understand. It must succeed at a DC 11 flat check to use linguistic actions or supply verbal spellcasting components until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature is stunned 3 instead of stunned 1.</p>
