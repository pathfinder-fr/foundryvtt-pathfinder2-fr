<hr>
<p>You’ve taken your share of licks while scurrying around the battlefield and know how to defend yourself against opportunistic attackers. Your movement ends only when you critically fail an <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=1">Acrobatics</a> check to <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=29">Tumble Through</a> an enemy’s space (or when you don’t have enough Speed to move all the way through its space). You still trigger reactions on a failure to Tumble Through, but you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against attacks that you trigger in this way.&nbsp;</p>
