------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your elemental lineage manifests as magma and molten rock, and you can focus the magma into your hand to attack your foes. You gain a magma spike unarmed attack, which requires a free hand to use. This is an agile, finesse, unarmed attack in the brawling weapon group that deals [[/r 1d4 #piercing]] piercing damage, as well as [[/r 1]] additional fire damage. Instead of the normal critical specialization effect, the target takes [[/r 1d6 #persistent fire]] persistent fire damage; you gain a bonus on this persistent damage equal to your item bonus to attack rolls on unarmed attacks.</p>
