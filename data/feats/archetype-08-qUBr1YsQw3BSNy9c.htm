<p>You've learned to recognize the telltale writings and other&nbsp;signs that indicate the presence of magical traps. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to find magical traps, to AC against attacks made by magical traps, to saves against magical traps, and to checks to Disable magical traps. Even if you aren't Searching, you get a check to find magical traps that normally require you to be Searching. You still need to meet any other requirements to find the trap. You're also adept at avoiding the effects of traps that feature magical writing, such as runes, glyphs, ancient script, or other forms. When you attempt a saving throw against the effects of these traps, if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead. If you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.</p>
