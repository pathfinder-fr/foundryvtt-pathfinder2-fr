------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You're in Arcane Cascade stance and have a hand free.</p>
<hr />
<p>You weave distracting magic with one hand to enhance your Spellstrike. Make a Spellstrike and @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.QNAVeNKtHA0EUw4X]{Feint} against the target of your Strike. Do this immediately before making the Strike, but after choosing your target.</p>
<p>The Feint gains the arcane, illusion, and visual traits, and it always has the basic effects of a Feint, rather than applying any adjustments or alternate effects from other feats or abilities.</p>
