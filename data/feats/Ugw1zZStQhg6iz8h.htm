<p>You’ve fiddled with knots, locks, and blacksmith’s puzzles since you were a child to give your hands something to do. You gain the trained proficiency rank in <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=17">Thievery</a> (or another skill of your choice, if you’re already trained in Thievery). If you roll a success on a Thievery check to Pick a Lock, you get a critical success instead.&nbsp;</p>
