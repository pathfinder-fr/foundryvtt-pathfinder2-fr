------ Description (en) ------
<p>You are skilled at tracking big game animals and similar creatures. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.JYi4MnsdFu618hPm]{Hunt Prey} action, but you can designate only animals, beasts, and dragons as prey. In addition to the other benefits of Hunt Prey, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks against your hunted prey.</p>
<p>When you succeed at a Strike against your hunted prey while it's @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed}, it must attempt a Fortitude save against your class DC. On a failure, the prey's Speeds are each reduced by 10 feet for 1 round; on a critical failure, the duration of this effect is 1 minute. The prey is then temporarily immune to this effect for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>If you already have Hunt Prey, you become an expert in Survival. You apply the Stealth bonus and the Speed reduction only when your prey is an animal, beast, or dragon.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the game hunter archetype.</p>
