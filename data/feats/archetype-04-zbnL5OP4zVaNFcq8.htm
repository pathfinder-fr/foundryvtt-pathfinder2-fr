------ Description (en) ------
<p>You give a quick shout, hoping to shake the fog clouding your ally's thoughts.</p>
<p>Choose one target ally within your marshal's aura who is affected by a mental effect that allowed a Will save and has a duration of no longer than 1 minute. That ally can immediately attempt a Will save with a +1 circumstance bonus against the effect's DC, ending the effect on a success. This can't end the effect for any creatures other than your target ally.</p>
<p>Regardless of the result of the save, your ally is temporarily immune to Snap Out of It! for 10 minutes.</p>
