<p>Your skill and dedication have set you on a path to master the techniques of Jalmeray's greatest martial artists: victors of the Challenge of Sky and Heaven. You become trained in either Acrobatics or Occultism. You gain either the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.yA9tsWT9uzL2REnw]{Ki Rush} or @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.3a07jkWezSuORSpS]{Ki Strike} monk feat, which grants you a ki spell and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Refocus} activity as a monk does. If you already have both these feats, you can instead choose a single 1st-level monk feat. <br><br><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Jalmeri Heavenseeker archetype.</p>
