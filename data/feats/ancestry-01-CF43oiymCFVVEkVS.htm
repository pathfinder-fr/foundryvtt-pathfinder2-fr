You also become trained in Automaton Lore.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancement</strong> Your gain greater understanding. Increase your proficiency rank in either Arcana or Crafting, as well as Automaton Lore, to expert. If you were already an expert in the chosen skill, increase your rank to master instead.</p>
