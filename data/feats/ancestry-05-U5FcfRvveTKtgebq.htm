<p>You’ve spent enough time on fire that you know how to use it to your advantage. You can light yourself thoroughly on fire with a held torch, a bottle of alchemist’s fire, or a similar incendiary, dealing yourself 1d6 persistent fire damage. As long as you are suffering persistent fire damage, all your melee attacks against adjacent creatures deal an additional 1 fire damage per weapon damage die. Any creature that successfully @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.PMbdMWc2QroouFGD]{Grapples}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.7blmbDrQFNfdT731]{Shoves}, or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.ge56Lu1xXVFYUnLP]{Trips} you takes 1d6 fire damage; if it uses a weapon for that action, the weapon takes the damage instead. You must still attempt the flat check to remove the persistent fire damage each round, as normal.&nbsp;</p>
