<p>You’ve spent enough time on fire that you know how to use it to your advantage. You can light yourself thoroughly on fire with a held &lt;%TREASURE60%%%&gt;torch, a bottle of <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=75">alchemist’s fire</a>, or a similar incendiary, dealing yourself 1d6 persistent fire damage. As long as you are suffering persistent fire damage, all your melee attacks against adjacent creatures deal an additional 1 fire damage per weapon damage die. Any creature that successfully <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=35">Grapples</a>, <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=38">Shoves</a>, or <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=40">Trips</a> you takes 1d6 fire damage; if it uses a weapon for that action, the weapon takes the damage instead. You must still attempt the flat check to remove the persistent fire damage each round, as normal.&nbsp;</p>
