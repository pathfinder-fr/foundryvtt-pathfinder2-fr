------ Description (en) ------
<p>As your body continues to rot and putrefy, your senses deaden and your undead powers grow. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.ancestryfeatures.YGk41WV42aTM7CQV]{Advanced Undead Benefits} as well as a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against emotion and pain effects. While your body is deteriorated, your numbness amplifies in two ways: the circumstance bonus from this feat increases to +2, and if you roll a success on a saving throw against an emotion or pain effect, you get a critical success instead.</p>
