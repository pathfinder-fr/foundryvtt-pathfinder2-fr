------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.5Q69PI8jdQVkb1ZT]{Cavalier Dedication}</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are riding a mount that has a melee @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strike} using its legs (claw, talons, hoof, etc.).</p>
<hr>
<p>You urge your mount forward, trampling enemies in your path. You command your mount to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Bcxarzksqt9ezrs6]{Stride} up to its Speed (or to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.H6v1VgowHaKHnVlG]{Burrow}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.cS9nfDRGD83bNU1p]{Fly}, or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.c8TGiZ48ygoSPofx]{Swim}, if it has the corresponding movement type), moving through the spaces of any foes in your path up to one size smaller than your mount.</p>
<p>Your mount deals damage equal to the melee Strike using its legs to each creature whose space you move through, subject to a basic Reflex save against your mount's Athletics DC. On a critical failure, the creature also becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} until the end of your next turn. You can damage a given creature only once during this movement.</p>
