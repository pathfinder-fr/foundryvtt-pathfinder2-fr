<hr />
<p>You become surrounded by a swirling storm of rain, sand, snow, or clouds, whichever of those suits your bound terrain. This activity has traits appropriate to the storm you create-typically earth for sand and water for rain, snow, or clouds. You become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} for 1 minute. You can't use this concealment to Hide or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VMozDqMMuK5kpoX4]{Sneak}, as normal for concealment that makes your position obvious.</p>
