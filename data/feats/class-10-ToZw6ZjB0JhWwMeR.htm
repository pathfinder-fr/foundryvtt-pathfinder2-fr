<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An ally within the first range increment of your firearm or crossbow is hit by an attack, and you can see the attacker.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You're wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.</p>
<hr />
<p>You're always ready to take a quick shot to deflect a weapon or distract a foe enough to render them off target. The ally gains a +2 circumstance bonus to their AC against the triggering attack. You use this reaction after the result of the attack roll is revealed, so you know whether the +2 @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.21WIfSu7Xd7uKqV8]{Tumble Through}will make a sufficient difference.</p>
