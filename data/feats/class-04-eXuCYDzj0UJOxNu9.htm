<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.9XALeVNcmlIxf3tJ]{Twin Feint}</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are wielding two melee weapons, each in <br />a different hand.</p>
<hr />
<p>Your movements with two weapons are so swift and disorienting that they befuddle your opponent. When using Twin Feint, if both your @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strikes} deal damage to a targeted creature, the target must succeed at a Will saving throw against your class DC or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied} 1 until the end of your next turn.</p>
