------ Description (en) ------
<p>You have forgotten more about talismans than lesser warriors have ever known. Normally, affixing more than one talisman to an item causes the talismans to be suppressed, but when you @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.UAaQk93a30nx0nYY]{Affix a Talisman}, you can specially treat one item you're working on, allowing it to have two active talismans at once.</p>
<p>This special treatment ends if you use Affix a Talisman to treat a new item for this ability.</p>
