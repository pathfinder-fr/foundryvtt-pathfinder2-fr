------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>bloodline that grants divine or occult spells</p>
<hr>
<p>The spiritual essence in your blood has opened your senses to the world beyond. You gain spiritsense as an imprecise sense with a range of 60 feet.</p>
<p>Spiritsense allows you to sense the spirits of creatures within the listed range, including living creatures, most non-mindless undead, and haunts. As with your hearing and other imprecise senses, you still need to Seek to locate an undetected creature.</p>
<p>As spiritsense detects spiritual essence, not physical bodies, it can detect spirits projected by spells such as <em>project image </em>or possessing otherwise soulless objects. It can’t detect soulless bodies, constructs, or objects, and like most senses, it doesn’t penetrate through solid objects.</p>
