------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Access</strong> A character who performs a specialized mission for Clarethe Iomedar has access to this option.</p>
<hr />
<p>Rumors suggest this technique was pioneered by knights who undertook missions for Clarethe Iomedar at the half-moon, but many Crimson Reclaimers have since mastered it. You learn the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.mtxMpGWpwwWSbySj]{For Love, For Lightning}</em> focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the Refocus activity to recite the Crimson Oath and meditate on its teachings; if you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your knight reclaimant focus spells are divine spells; when you gain this feat, you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs. Charisma is the key spellcasting ability for knight reclaimant focus spells.</p>
