------ Description (en) ------
<p>You’ve learned to split your focus between multiple classes with ease. You gain a 2nd-level multiclass dedication feat (for more about multiclass archetypes, see page 219), even if you normally couldn’t take another dedication feat until you take more feats from your current archetype. If you’re a half-elf, you don’t need to meet the feat’s ability score prerequisites.</p>
