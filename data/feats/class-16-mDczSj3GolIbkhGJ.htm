------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An enemy misses you with a ranged attack using a type of ammunition appropriate to your weapon (a bullet if you're wielding a firearm).</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You're wielding an unloaded firearm or crossbow.</p>
<hr />
<p>With a single fluid gesture, you catch a projectile out of the air, load it in your weapon, and shoot it back at the attacker. Interact to load the projectile into your weapon, then make a Strike with the required weapon against the triggering opponent. Since you're using the foe's ammunition, this Strike applies any special effects that ammunition would have (for instance, if it was @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.rKknk8odXDBpON5l]{Explosive Ammunition}, it would explode in a burst of fire if your Strike hits).</p>
