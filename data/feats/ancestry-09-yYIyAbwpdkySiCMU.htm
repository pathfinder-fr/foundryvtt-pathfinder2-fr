------ Description (en) ------
<p>You squirrel away useful objects and seem to retrieve them at just the right time. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.lHFz4MmebvPqTb0A]{Prescient Consumable} and @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.bh2jHyyYrkLMsIdX]{Prescient Planner} feats, except that you always withdraw the objects from your cheek pouches. This means the object you retrieve must fit in your cheek pouches; this is generally an item of negligible Bulk unless you also have the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Pox93XMBaFmeLIDM]{Cheek Pouches} feat.</p>
