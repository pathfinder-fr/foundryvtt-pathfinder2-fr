<p>You’re always on the lookout for supplies and valuables. Each time you use the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} action to search for objects (including secret doors and hazards), you can search for objects in your choice of a 10-foot emanation around you or an adjacent 15-foot-by-15-foot area, rather than a single adjacent 10-foot-by-10-foot area.</p>
