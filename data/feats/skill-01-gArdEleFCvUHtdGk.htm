<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>trained in Nature</p>
<hr>
<p>You know how to encourage your mount to cover ground quickly.</p>
<p>When calculating your travel speed (<em>Core Rulebook </em>479) for the day while mounted, you can attempt a Nature check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.q9nbyIF0PEBqMtYe]{Command an Animal} to increase your mount’s travel speed. The DC is determined by the GM, but is typically based on the mount’s level or the difficulty of the environment, whichever is harder.</p>
<p>On a success, increase your mount’s travel speed by half. This has no effect on your mount’s movement in encounters.</p>
