------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You use Arcane Cascade.</p>
<hr />
<p>When you enter your Arcane Cascade, you disperse the magical reinforcement to nearby allies. You grant the extra damage of Arcane Cascade in an aura affecting all allies in a 5-foot emanation. This uses only the base damage of the stance, based on the ally's weapon specialization; it doesn't use any increase you get from bonuses, the laughing shadow hybrid study, or the like.</p>
<p>As normal for duplicate effects, multiple Arcane Cascades affecting the same creature aren't cumulative.</p>
