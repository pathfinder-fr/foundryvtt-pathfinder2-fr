------ Description (en) ------
<p>You have learned Artokus Kirran’s most hidden secrets, granting you the ability to create alchemy infused with the power of wishes. Once per day when you use @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Pe0zmIqyTBc2Td0I]{Advanced Alchemy} during your daily preparations, you can spend a batch of infused reagents to create a wish vial containing a single common arcane spell of your choice of 8th level or lower. The spell must have a casting time of no more than 3 actions, no Cost, and must be able to target you. Only you can Activate the wish vial, which takes the same number of Interact actions as the spell’s casting time and grants you the effects of the spell.</p>
