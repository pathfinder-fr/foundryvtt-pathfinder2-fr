<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in Perception</p>
<hr>
<p>Your battle instincts make you more aware of concealed and invisible opponents. You don’t need to succeed at a flat check to target concealed creatures. You’re not flat-footed to creatures that are hidden from you (unless you’re flat-footed to them for reasons other than the hidden condition), and you need only a successful DC 5 flat check to target a hidden creature. While you’re adjacent to an undetected creature of your level or lower, it is instead only hidden from you.</p>
