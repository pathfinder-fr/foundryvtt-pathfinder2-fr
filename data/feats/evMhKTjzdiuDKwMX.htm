<hr>
<p>You are a paragon of all that is good, your overwhelming aura causing evildoers to cower. All evil creatures within 15 feet of you take a –1 status penalty to checks and DCs that target you or your allies. This penalty is –2 against creatures you have taken an oath against (such as dragons if you have the Dragonslayer Oath feat). You can choose to suppress or resume this aura as an action, which has the concentrate trait.</p>
