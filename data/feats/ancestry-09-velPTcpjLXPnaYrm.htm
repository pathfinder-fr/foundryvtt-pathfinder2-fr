<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">If you rest outdoors for 10 minutes during the day, you regain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier × half your level. You gain this benefit in addition to any healing from @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.1kGNdIIhuglAjIp9]{Treat Wounds}. Leshies whose plant nourishment does not rely on photosynthesis require a similarly suitable environment. For example, fungus leshies need dark, damp environments and a pile of decaying plant matter.&nbsp;</span></p>
