<p>You force your mental anguish outward, projecting it upon those around you. You gain an aura of despair in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30] lasting 5 rounds. A creature that enters or begins its turn in the aura must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classOrSpellDC)] save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC or be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 1} (@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2} on a critical failure). A creature that succeeds at the save is temporarily immune to Mummy's Despair for 10 minutes.</p>
