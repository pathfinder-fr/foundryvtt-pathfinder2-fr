------ Description (en) ------
<p>You channel a power that stifles dangerous words. Make a melee Strike. If the attack hits, the target is unable to speak in a voice louder than a whisper for 1 round. This prevents the target from using most auditory effects involving its voice, and it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check to Cast a Spell with a verbal component or the spell is disrupted. If your Strike is a critical hit, the target is entirely unable to speak for 1 round and is limited to a whisper for 1 minute thereafter. Once a creature has been affected by this ability, it is temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>
