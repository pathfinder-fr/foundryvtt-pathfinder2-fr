<hr />
<p>You have been granted a sliver of the power of the yamaraj, the magistrates of the dead who agreed to allow duskwalkers to exist at all. You exhale a blast of icy wind and ravenous insects. This is a 30-foot cone that deals [[/r 14d6 #slashing]] slashing damage and [[/r 4d6 #persistent slashing]] persistent slashing damage (basic Reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). On a critical failure, targets also become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened} 2.</p>
