------ Description (en) ------
<p>You fragment a ranged spell into a pair of smaller shots. If your next action is to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell} without a duration that requires an attack roll against a single target and has no effect beyond dealing damage, you roll a single attack roll and compare the result to the AC of two targets within the spell’s range. The spell deals only half its usual damage to each target.</p>
<p>This counts as one attack for your multiple attack penalty.</p>
