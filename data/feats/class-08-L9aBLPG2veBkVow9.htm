<p>You can cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.TUj8eugNqAvB1vVR]{Creation} as an innate spell at will, choosing whether it is arcane or primal each time. The created object lasts until you spend 1 hour not within its immediate vicinity or until it is destroyed. Such objects are called persistent creations. If you cast <em>creation</em> again, any persistent creation you previously created with the spell immediately disintegrates.&nbsp;</p>
