<p>You can cast <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=54"><em>creation</em></a> as an innate spell at will, choosing whether it is arcane or primal each time. The created object lasts until you spend 1 hour not within its immediate vicinity or until it is destroyed. Such objects are called persistent creations. If you cast <em>creation</em> again, any persistent creation you previously created with the spell immediately disintegrates.&nbsp;</p>
