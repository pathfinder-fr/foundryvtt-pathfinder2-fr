------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Access</strong> You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.</p>
<hr />
<p>Your family's traditions of defending against Geb's undead have granted you a sixth sense for detecting spirits, haunts, and other restless dead, no matter their form or the strength of their presence. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.1xRFPTFtWtGJ9ELw]{Sense Motive} when trying to determine if a creature is possessed or under the influence of an effect that would make them controlled, a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks made to see through disguises worn by undead, and a +2 circumstance bonus when using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} action to find @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} or undetected haunts or undead within 30 feet of you.</p>
<p>If you aren't using the Seek action or searching, the GM automatically rolls a secret check for you to notice haunts or undead within 30 feet anyway. This check doesn't gain the usual +2 circumstance bonus, and instead takes a -2 circumstance penalty.</p>
