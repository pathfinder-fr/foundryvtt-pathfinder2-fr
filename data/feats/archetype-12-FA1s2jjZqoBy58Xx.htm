------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your shadow's voice grows ever clearer; it whispers secrets of true power to you and shields your flesh from harm. Your shadow reservoir gains an additional spell 1 level below the highest level spell you can cast, in addition to the spells it already contains for all the levels below that.</p>
<p>In addition, the tattoos generated by casting shadow spells protect your body against harmful energies. You gain negative resistance equal to the highest level of spell you can cast from spell slots; if you have negative healing (or are otherwise harmed by positive damage and not negative damage), you instead gain positive resistance in the same amount.</p>
