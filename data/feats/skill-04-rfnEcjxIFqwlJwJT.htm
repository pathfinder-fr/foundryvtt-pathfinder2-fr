<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.MJg24e9fJd7OASvF]{Medic Dedication}</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are holding healer's tools, or you are wearing them and have a hand free.</p>
<hr>
<p>You treat an adjacent creature in an attempt to reduce the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.i3OJZU2nk64Df3xm]{Clumsy}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled}, or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened} condition. If a creature has multiple conditions from this list, choose one.</p>
<p>Attempt a counteract check against the condition, using your Medicine modifier as your counteract modifier and the condition's source to determine the DC.</p>
<p>You can't treat a condition that came from an artifact or effect above 20th level unless you have Legendary Medic; even if you do, the counteract DC increases by 10.</p>
<p>Treating a Condition that is continually applied under certain circumstances (for instance, the enfeebled condition a good character gains from carrying an <em>unholy</em> weapon) has no effect as long as the circumstances continue.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Reduce the condition value by 2.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> Reduce the condition value by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Increase the condition value by 1.</p>
