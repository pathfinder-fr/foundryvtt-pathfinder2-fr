------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your body exudes an overwhelming scent of decay in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10], so putrid that it nauseates creates within that range. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classOrSpellDC)] save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} (plus @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} on a critical failure). While within the aura, the creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to Corpse Stench for 1 minute.</p>
