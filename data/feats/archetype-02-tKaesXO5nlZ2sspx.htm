<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>trained in Survival</p>

<p>When focused on finding your quarry, you're relentless. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.JYi4MnsdFu618hPm]{Hunt Prey} action. You can use Hunt Prey to designate only a creature that you've seen, heard about, or learned about through some other means, such as a bounty board or wanted poster. In addition to the other benefits of Hunt Prey, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.plBGdZhqq5JBl1D8]{Gather Information} regarding your prey.</p>
<p>If you already have Hunt Prey, you become an expert in Survival and gain the circumstance bonus to Gather Information about your prey; you can still designate a creature you're tracking during exploration, in addition to the conditions above.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the bounty hunter archetype.</p>
