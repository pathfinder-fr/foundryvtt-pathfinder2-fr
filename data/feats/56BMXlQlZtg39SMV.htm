<p>When you cast doubt upon your foes, the effect lasts longer than usual. After being enfeebled 2 by your Glimpse of Redemption, the foe is enfeebled 1 for 1 minute. If you have Weight of Guilt, after being stupefied 2 by your Glimpse of Redemption, the foe is stupefied 1 for 1 minute or until the flat check from stupefied causes it to lose a spell, whichever comes first.</p>
