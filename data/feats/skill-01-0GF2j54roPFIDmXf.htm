------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>trained in Diplomacy</p>
<hr>
<p>You launch an insightful quip at a foe, distracting them. Choose a foe within 30 feet and roll a Diplomacy check against the target’s Will DC.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is distracted and takes a –3 status <br>penalty to Perception and Will saves for 1 minute.</p>
<p>The target can end the effect early with a retort to your Bon Mot. This can either be a single action that has the concentrate trait or an appropriate skill action to frame their retort. The GM <br>determines which skill actions qualify, though they must <br>take at least 1 action. Typically, the retort needs to use a linguistic Charisma-based skill action.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the penalty is –2.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your quip is atrocious. You take the same <br>penalty an enemy would take had you succeeded. This ends <br>after 1 minute or if you issue another Bon Mot and succeed.</p>
