<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion</p>
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within line of sight casts a spell that you don’t have prepared or in your spell repertoire, or a trap or similar object casts such a spell. You must be aware of the casting</p>
<hr>
<p>If you are trained in the appropriate skill for the spell’s tradition and it’s a common spell of 2nd level or lower, you automatically identify it (you still roll to attempt to get a critical success, but can’t get a worse result than success). The highest level of spell you automatically identify increases to 4 if you’re an expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 10 if you’re legendary. The GM rolls a secret Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check, whichever corresponds to the tradition of the spell being cast. If you’re not trained in the skill, you can’t get a result better than failure.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Success:</strong> You correctly recognize the spell and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your saving throw or your AC against it.</p>
<p><strong>Success:</strong> You correctly recognize the spell.</p>
<p><strong>Failure:</strong> You fail to recognize the spell.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure:</strong> You misidentify the spell as another spell entirely, of the GM’s choice.</p>
