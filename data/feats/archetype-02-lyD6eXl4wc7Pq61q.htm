------ Description (en) ------
<p>You've compiled a vast repository of information that touches on nearly every subject. You are trained in Loremaster Lore, a special Lore skill that can be used only to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.1OagaWtBpVXExToo]{Recall Knowledge}, but on any topic.</p>
<p>If you have legendary proficiency in a skill used to Decipher Writing, you gain expert proficiency in Loremaster Lore, but you can't increase your proficiency rank in Loremaster Lore by any other means.</p>
<p>You can take feats in the loremaster's additional feats entry even if you don't meet the @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.4ripp6EfdVpS0d60]{Enigma (Bard Muse)} prerequisite.</p>
<p>If you have the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.uVXEZblPRuCyPRua]{Bardic Lore} class feat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with Bardic Lore.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the loremaster archetype.</p>
