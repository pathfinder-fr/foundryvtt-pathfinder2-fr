------ Description (en) ------
<p>You are adept at disguising coded messages as folksy idioms. Using slang, jokes, halfling loanwords, and the like, you convey a simple message consisting of three basic words (such as “Danger assassin flee” or “Meet me moonrise”).</p>
<p>Your intended listener can attempt a Perception check to discern the message (DC 20 if an ally, DC15 if a halfling ally, DC 10 if a halfling ally with Folksy Patter).</p>
<p>Eavesdroppers can also attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC to discern your meaning. Any bonuses or penalties to Perception checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.1xRFPTFtWtGJ9ELw]{Sense Motive} apply.</p>
