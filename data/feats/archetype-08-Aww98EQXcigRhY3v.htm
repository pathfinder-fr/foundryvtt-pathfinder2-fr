------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your saliva causes severe nausea and mild fever in the living, weakening them so that you can more easily finish them off. When you critically hit a creature with your jaws, the creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1}. This is a disease effect.</p>
<p>If you are satiated, you can end your satiation to make the target @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} on a regular hit instead.</p>
