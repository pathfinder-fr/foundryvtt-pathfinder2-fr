<hr />
<p>You have some feature that allows you to quickly evade effects that restrain you. Attempt a check to Escape. If you succeed, you can Stride, Step, or make a Strike with a melee unarmed attack targeting the creature you Escaped from. If you fail, you instead attempt to Escape a second time. <br />You increase your multiple attack penalty as appropriate for the actions you took, but only after completing both actions.</p>
