------ Description (en) ------
<p>You command the attention of all around you with style, ensuring their gaze falls only upon you until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>When creatures within 30 feet of you attempt saving throws against other visual effects, they use the outcome for one degree of success better than the result they rolled.</p>
<p>An enemy within the area attempting to use a visual effect that involves focusing its attention on a particular creature (such as a medusa's Focus Gaze) must succeed at a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, in order to target any creature except you.</p>
<p>Allies in the area can attempt to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.XMcnh4cSI32tljXa]{Hide} even if they don't have cover, as you are continually providing a distraction.</p>
