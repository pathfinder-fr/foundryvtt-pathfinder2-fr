<p><strong>Trigger</strong> One of the required allies is about to attempt an attack roll or skill check.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You spent 10 minutes during your daily <br>preparations reviewing stratagems for the day’s adventures <br>with up to four allies.</p>
<hr>
<p>You quickly advise your ally, using your earlier planning to make sure luck can’t throw a wrench in the cogs of your schemes.</p>
<p>The ally rolls the triggering check twice and takes the better of the two results. That ally then becomes temporarily immune to your Inspired Stratagem until your next daily preparations.</p>
