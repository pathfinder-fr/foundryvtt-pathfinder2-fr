------ Description (en) ------
<p>You vent a jet of supercooled fluid from your innovation, damaging a foe and slowing it down. Target one creature within 60 feet. That creature takes cold damage equal to your level, with effects depending on its Reflex save.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target takes half damage and takes a -5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target takes full damage and takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target takes double damage, is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} for 1 round, and takes a -15-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.</p>
<p><strong>Unstable Function</strong> Your innovation discharges an enormous cone of supercooled fluid, potentially causing cascading failures. Add the unstable trait to Deep Freeze. The ability affects all creatures within a <span data-pf2-effect-area="cone" data-pf2-distance="60" data-pf2-traits="cold,inventor,manipulate">60-foot cone</span> instead of a single target, and it deals cold damage equal to double your level instead of equal to your level.</p>
<p>If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, you can choose a <span data-pf2-effect-area="cone" data-pf2-distance="60" data-pf2-traits="cold,inventor,manipulate">60-foot cone</span> or <span data-pf2-effect-area="cone" data-pf2-distance="90" data-pf2-traits="cold,inventor,manipulate">90-foot cone</span> when you use an unstable Deep Freeze.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you.</p>
