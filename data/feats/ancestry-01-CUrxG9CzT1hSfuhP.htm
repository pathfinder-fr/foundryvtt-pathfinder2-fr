------ Description (en) ------
<p>You can produce a soft silk to weave into useful items. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.dTjzxCy9pku5gL0F]{Specialty Crafting (Weaving)} feat. You can use your webbing to Craft simple, nonconsumable threaded items, such as clothing and rope, at zero cost as long as their base Price is 1 sp or less. These items have no resale value, and they naturally degrade after 24 hours without regular (if minor) maintenance. You can maintain up to 10 such items at a time; if you create a new one, your oldest creation breaks down from neglect. These temporary items take you only 1 day to Craft instead of 4. If you’re an expert in Crafting, you can Craft these items in 1 hour; if you’re a master, you can Craft them in 10 minutes; if you’re legendary, you can Craft them in 1 minute.</p>
