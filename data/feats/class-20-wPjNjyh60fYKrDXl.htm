------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your ability to summon extends past your other spellcasting. When you sacrifice a 9th-level spell slot to gain two summoning slots using Master Summoner, you can use those slots to cast summoning spells heightened to 10th level.</p>
<p>You can't use these spell slots for any purpose other than casting the summoning spells, and you don't count as having 10th-level spell slots for other abilities or rules.</p>
