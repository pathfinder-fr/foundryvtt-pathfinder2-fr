------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your spotter critically succeeds at a Strike against a creature, and that creature is within your ranged weapon's first range increment.</p>
<hr />
<p>You take advantage of your spotter's devastating attack to unleash your own follow-up attack. Make a ranged Strike with a -2 penalty against the target of the triggering attack. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to the Strike.</p>
