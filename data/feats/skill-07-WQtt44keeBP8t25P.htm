------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are not @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.HL2l2VRSaQHu9lUw]{Fatigued}.</p>
<hr />
<p>Channeling the energy of the Crimson Oath into your voice, you pronounce a threat in a tone so icy it freezes the blood. Attempt an Intimidation check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.2u915NdUyQan6uKF]{Demoralize}; you don't suffer a penalty if the target doesn't understand the language you're speaking, but this otherwise functions as normal. You can't use Intimidating Glare or any other effect that would cause your Demoralize attempt to lose the auditory trait as part of using this feat. If you critically succeed at your Intimidation check, the target becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 1}, or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 2} if the target is undead. After using this feat, you are fatigued until the end of your next turn, and you can't use this feat again until the end of your next turn.</p>
