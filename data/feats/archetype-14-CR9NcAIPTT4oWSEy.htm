<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.AimSmPyiMhJZVZRq]{Mauler Dedication}</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You’re wielding a non-finesse melee weapon <br>in two hands.</p>
<hr>
<p>You smash the ground with your weapon, knocking nearby creatures to the ground.</p>
<p>Choose a square within your reach, including your own space. If there’s a foe in the chosen square, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strike} that foe with the required weapon. Then attempt to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.ge56Lu1xXVFYUnLP]{Trip} every foe in the chosen square plus each square adjacent to that square, ignoring Trip’s requirement that you have a hand free. This counts as three attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn’t increase until after you’ve made the Strike, if any, and all the Trip attempts.</p>
