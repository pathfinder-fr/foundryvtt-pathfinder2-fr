------ Description (en) ------
<p>Natural obstacles pose no obstacle to you. You gain the ranger's @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.RlwE99yKnhq8FUuy]{Wild Stride} class feature. This allows you to ignore the effects of all non-magical difficult terrain, treat greater difficult terrain as merely difficult terrain, and gives you an additional benefit from @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.sgo7J9BVofBqwlsF]{Favored Terrain} based on the terrain.</p>
