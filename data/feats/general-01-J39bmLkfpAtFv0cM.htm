<hr>
<p>You’ve learned to mimic the abilities of spellcasters by studying their flourishes and words. When you activate a magic item to generate a spell effect, attempt a Deception check. If you succeed against an onlooker’s Perception DC, to that onlooker, you appear to Cast that Spell instead. Onlookers who successfully Recognize the Spell realize you used a magic item, though those who later successfully Identify the Magic still can’t determine that the source of the effect was a magic item.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
