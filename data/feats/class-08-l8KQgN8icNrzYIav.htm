------ Description (en) ------
<p>You have trained your mind and body to tolerate polymorph magic for longer periods of time, so long as you prepare for the change appropriately.</p>
<p>When preparing a polymorph spell that lasts 1 minute and grants a battle form, you can prepare the spell in a slot 2 levels higher than normal. This doesn&rsquo;t grant any of the normal benefits of heightening a spell, but the spell lasts up to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>For example, if you prepared @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.wp09USMB3GIW1qbp]{Animal Form}&nbsp;in a 4th-level slot with Form Retention, you would cast a 2nd-level <em>animal form</em> that lasts for up to 10 minutes. If the spell can be Dismissed, that doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>
