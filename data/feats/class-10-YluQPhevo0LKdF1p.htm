Name: Just One More Thing
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> Your most recent action was to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.QNAVeNKtHA0EUw4X]{Feint}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.DCb62iCBrJXy0Ik6]{Request}, <br>or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.2u915NdUyQan6uKF]{Demoralize}, and you failed but didn't critically fail.</p>
<hr>
<p>After your attempt to influence someone goes poorly, you add another bit of information or ask a pointed question, possibly salvaging your previous attempt.</p>
<p>Reroll the failed check and use the new result. If the target of the failed check is the subject of a lead you're pursuing, double your bonus from @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.xTK2zsWFyxSJvYbX]{Pursue a Lead} on the rerolled check. That creature is temporarily immune to Just One More Thing for 1 day.</p>
<p>You can also use this action if you failed, but didn't critically fail, at a check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.ewwCglB7XOPLUz72]{Lie}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.plBGdZhqq5JBl1D8]{Gather Information}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OX4fy22hQgUHDr0q]{Make an Impression}, or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.tHCqgwjtQtzNqVvd]{Coerce}. In this case, rather than spending 1 action, adding Just One More Thing takes you half the amount of time you initially spent on the check, to a minimum of 1 more round.</p>
