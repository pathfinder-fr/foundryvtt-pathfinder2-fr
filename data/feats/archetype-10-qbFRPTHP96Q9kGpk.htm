------ Description (en) ------
<p>You make a fearsome show of your authority. Roll Intimidation checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.2u915NdUyQan6uKF]{Demoralize} each creature in a @Template[type:cone|distance:30]. When you do so, Demoralize gains the visual trait, and creatures are affected if they can see you. If a target creature hasn't broken a law in the past week (as determined by the GM), the result of your check against that creature is one degree of success worse than the result you rolled.</p>
