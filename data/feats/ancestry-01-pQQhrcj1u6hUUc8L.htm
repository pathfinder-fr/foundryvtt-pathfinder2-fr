<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput"><strong>Access</strong> Taldan nationality<br><strong>Trigger</strong> You are affected by an <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=60">emotion</a> effect.<br></span></p>
<hr>
<p>Taldan pride means you never show weakness. Roll a <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=5">Deception</a> check and compare the result to any observing creatures’ Perception DCs. On a success, that creature believes you were unaffected by the emotion effect. A creature tricked in this manner can’t benefit from the emotion effect and can’t use abilities that require you to be under this emotion effect; for example, if you successfully use this ability to trick a <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=414">will-o’-wisp</a> into believing you aren’t under a <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=68">fear</a> effect, it can’t use its Feed on Fear ability on you.&nbsp;</p>
