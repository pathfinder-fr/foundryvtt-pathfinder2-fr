------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Access</strong> You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.</p>
<hr />
<p>Raised in the ancient halls of Dongun Hold or the surrounding region, you display your lineage with a clan pistol, rather than a clan dagger. You get one clan pistol of your clan for free, as it was given to you at birth. This replaces your clan dagger. Selling this pistol is a terrible taboo and earns you the disdain of other dwarves. You are trained with the clan pistol. In addition, when your clan pistol is visible, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on checks to Gather Information or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OX4fy22hQgUHDr0q]{Make an Impression} when interacting with citizens of Alkenstar, Dongun Hold, or their allies.</p>
