<p>When you use Medicine to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.MHLuKy4nQO2Z4Am1]{Administer First Aid}, instead of Stabilizing a character or Stopping Bleeding, you can reduce an ally's @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened} or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened} condition by 2, or remove either of those conditions entirely on a critical success. You can remove only one condition at a time.</p>
<p>The DC for the Medicine check is usually the DC of the effect that caused the condition.</p>
