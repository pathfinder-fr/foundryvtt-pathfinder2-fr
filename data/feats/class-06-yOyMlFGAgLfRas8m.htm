------ Description (en) ------
<p>With a stern call, carefully chosen barb, or some other challenging declaration, you demand your foe's attention in a duel. Choose an opponent within 30 feet who you can perceive and can hear you, and make your choice of a Deception or Intimidation check against the target's Will DC. No matter the result of the check, the foe is temporarily immune to your Pistolero's Challenge until noon the next day.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> Both you and the opponent gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls with Strikes made against each other. If you're a master in the skill you used for the check, the status bonus to damage rolls increases to +3, and if you're legendary, it increases to +4.</p>
<p>You can have only one challenge in effect at a time; challenging a new opponent ends this effect on any current target. Otherwise, the effect lasts until one of you is defeated, flees, or the encounter ends.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 1} and can't use this ability again for 1 minute.</p>
