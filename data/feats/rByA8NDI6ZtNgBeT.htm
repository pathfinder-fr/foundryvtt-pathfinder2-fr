------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your shots become nimble and deadly. While you’re in this stance, your ranged Strikes don’t trigger Attacks of Opportunity or other reactions that are triggered by a ranged attack. If you have Attack of Opportunity, you can use it with a loaded ranged weapon you’re wielding. The triggering creature must be within 5 feet of you for you to do so.</p>
