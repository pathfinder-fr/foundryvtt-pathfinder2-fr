------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You're wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.</p>
<hr />
<p>You attempt to finish your target with a final, well-placed shot. Make a crossbow or firearm Strike. If you've damaged the target within the last minute with the same weapon and you get a critical success on your attack roll, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or die; this is a death and incapacitation effect. A creature that survives is temporarily immune for 1 day. Creatures with no head (such as dullahans or oozes) are immune to this ability, and creatures with redundant heads (such as ettins) might survive the destruction of a head.</p>
