------ Description (en) ------
<p>You can create extraordinary—albeit volatile—alchemical wonders, though they have an unfortunate tendency to violently explode when you use them.</p>
<p>When you use @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.NlEZ0piDxg9buXCL]{Quick Alchemy}, you can create an alchemical item from your formula book whose level is up to 2 higher than your advanced alchemy level. You can spend up to 3 additional batches of @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.wySB9VHOW1v3TX1L]{Infused Reagents} when creating this item to stabilize it.</p>
<p>Upon activating the item, attempt a DC 10 flat check; for every additional batch of @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.wySB9VHOW1v3TX1L]{Infused Reagents} you spent to create the item, reduce this DC by 2. On a success, the item functions normally. On a failure, the item explodes, dealing force damage to the user equal to twice the item’s level (doubled on a critical failure).</p>
