------ Description (en) ------
<p>You've found a way to use a hodgepodge combination of devices to enhance your visual abilities in every situation. You gain darkvision and low-light vision, and you can see @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible} creatures and objects as translucent shapes, though these shapes are indistinct enough to be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} to you.</p>
<p>If an effect would give you the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} condition, the effect must attempt a counteract check against your class DC, with your counteract level equaling half your level, rounded up. On a failed counteract check, you aren't blinded-your various devices are able to compensate.</p>
