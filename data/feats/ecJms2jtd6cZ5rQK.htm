------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Your elven lineage is subtle enough that you look barely different from other humans, and you’ve learned to use that to your advantage. You gain the trained proficiency rank in <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=5">Deception</a> (or another skill of your choice, if you were already trained in Deception). You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Impersonate checks to pretend you aren’t a half-elf. Observers are never granted circumstance bonuses to Perception checks due to you Impersonating a full-blooded human, and you never take circumstance penalties due to you Impersonating a full-blooded human.<br><br><strong>Special</strong> You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can’t retrain out of this feat or into this feat.&nbsp;</span></p>
