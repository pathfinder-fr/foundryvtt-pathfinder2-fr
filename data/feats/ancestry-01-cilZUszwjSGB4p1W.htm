------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your body is designed to be particularly resilient. Your chassis is medium armor in the plate armor group that grants a +4 item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of -2, a speed penalty of -5 feet, and a Strength value of 16. You can never wear other armor or remove your chassis; however, you still don't become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.HL2l2VRSaQHu9lUw]{Fatigued} from sleeping. Finally, you can etch armor runes onto your chassis as normal.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancement</strong> Your chassis becomes difficult to overcome. You gain the Chassis Deflection reaction.</p>
