------ Description (en) ------
<p>You can patch up damage to an object with a quick fix. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.xT593tHyPkumPuzz]{Improvised Repair} general feat. When you use Improvised Repair, you can attempt a Crafting check with the same DC as Repair. If you succeed, you can use the object as a normal object of its type until it takes damage rather than as a shoddy object of its type.</p>
