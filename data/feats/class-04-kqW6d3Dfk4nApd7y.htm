<p>The GM rolls a secret Occultism check for you against the Deception or Stealth DC (whichever is higher) of an enemy of your choice who is engaged in combat and isn't <a class="entity-link" data-pack="pf2e.conditionspf2e" data-id="DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W" draggable="true"><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> Concealed</a> from you, <a class="entity-link" data-pack="pf2e.conditionspf2e" data-id="iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC" draggable="true"><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> Hidden</a> from you, or <a class="entity-link" data-pack="pf2e.conditionspf2e" data-id="VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf" draggable="true"><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> Undetected</a> by you. The GM might apply a penalty for the distance between you and the enemy. The enemy is then temporarily immune to your Combat Reading for 1 day.</p>
