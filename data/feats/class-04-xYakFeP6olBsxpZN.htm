<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> harmful font, evil alignment</p>
<hr>
<p>You grasp the animating force within an undead creature and bend it to your will. If the next action you use is to cast harm targeting one undead creature, you transform the effects of that harm spell. Instead of harm’s normal effects, the target becomes controlled by you if its level is equal to or lower than your level – 3. It can attempt a Will saving throw to resist being controlled by you. If the target is already under someone else’s command, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw, and the undead uses the better result.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The undead creature becomes a minion under your control. The spell gains a duration of 1 minute, but it is dismissed if you or an ally attacks the minion undead.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.</p>
