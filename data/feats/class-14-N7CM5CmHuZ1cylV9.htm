------ Description (en) ------
<p>You spend 10 minutes in contemplation to uncannily predict how events will play out. Choose a particular goal or activity you plan to engage in within 1 week, or an event you expect might happen within 1 week. You analyze whether it’s likely to come to pass, learning whether it’s highly likely, somewhat likely, somewhat unlikely, or highly unlikely. You also gain a piece of advice suggesting a course of action you or your allies could take that might make the chosen event more or less likely, whichever you prefer.</p>
<p>The GM determines the likeliness of the event and the piece of advice you learn.</p>
