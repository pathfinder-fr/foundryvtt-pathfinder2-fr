<p>You unfold your wings for travel and can keep them unfolded for 10 minutes. You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed while your wings are unfurled. If you have Fledgling Flight, you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your fly Speed with Juvenile Flight. As normal, since your fly Speed is derived from your land Speed, this status bonus isn’t cumulative with a status bonus to your land Speed, if you have one.</p>
