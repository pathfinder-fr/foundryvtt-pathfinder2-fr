------ Description (en) ------
<p>After years of study and careful planning, you finally completed a soul cage to house your soul and successfully performed a ritual to transform yourself into a lich. Now, neither death nor time can prevent you from pursuing your studies and achieving your grand ambitions. You gain the undead trait and the basic undead benefits. Your undead craving is for knowledge.</p>
<p>You gain a unique <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.qFVPeeJ70B1u2n81]{Soul Cage}</em>—a magic item that houses your soul. Whenever you would die, your soul flees to the soul cage to allow you to be rebuilt. As long as your soul cage exists, you can't truly be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the lich archetype.</p>
