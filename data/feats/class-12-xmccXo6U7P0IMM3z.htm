<p>Your skill and fervor allow you to pierce undead defenses and exploit their weaknesses. When you make an attack using a weapon with which you have master proficiency and hit an undead creature, you ignore 5 points of the creature’s resistances, and the undead’s weaknesses are 2 higher against your attack.&nbsp;</p>
