<p>You imbue water with your deity’s blessing. Choose a container of water on your person that is of light Bulk. For 1 round, if you or an ally throw this container at a foe, it has the damaging effects of <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=245">holy water</a> (if you follow a good deity) or <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=248">unholy water</a> (if you follow an evil deity). The water’s transient power doesn’t make it gain any value, allow it to be used to supply the cost for a spell or ritual, and so on. If you have legendary proficiency in <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=13">Religion</a>, you can sanctify three containers held by you or allies within your reach instead of one.&nbsp;</p>
