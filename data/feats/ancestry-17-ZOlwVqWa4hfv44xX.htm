------ Description (en) ------
<p>You have begun the final steps to reaching your full potential. Your wings are always in their majestic form without you needing to use Energize Wings, granting you a permanent fly Speed. Furthermore, sprites recognize you as a powerful hero (or villain) by your unique wings and are appropriately impressed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all Diplomacy and Intimidation checks against sprites and gain the benefits of the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.cc8O47KFsODReoBe]{Glad-Hand} skill feat against other sprites, without taking a –5 penalty to your Diplomacy check.</p>
