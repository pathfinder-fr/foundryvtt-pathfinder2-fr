------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your enzymes can paralyze your foes rather than merely making it harder for them to heal their wounds. Strike with your claw or jaws. If you hit a living non-elf creature, it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed} unless it succeeds at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classOrSpellDC)] save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Regardless of the result of the save, the creature is temporarily immune to Paralyzing Slash for 24 hours. A creature that becomes paralyzed can attempt a new save to end the paralysis at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.</p>
