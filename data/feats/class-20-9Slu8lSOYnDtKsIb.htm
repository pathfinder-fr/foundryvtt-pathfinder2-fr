------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You would be reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p>
<p>In a burst of flame, you return to health like a phoenix rising from the ashes. Change your current Hit Points to 30 and cast a 6th-level fireball centered on yourself. This fireball doesn't affect you. Your hair turns brilliant red for 1 hour.</p>
<p>If you haven't used Ruby Resurrection and you die, you stay in initiative order and Ruby Resurrection triggers automatically at the start of your next turn, bringing you back to life at 0 HP before having its normal effects. This happens only if there are some remains to resurrect; for instance, if you were killed by disintegrate you wouldn't return.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast.</p>
