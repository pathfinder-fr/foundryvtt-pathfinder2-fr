<hr>
<p>Your faith and hope can’t be shaken, and you won’t flee when lives are at stake. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saves against <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=68">fear</a> effects and <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=60">emotion</a> effects that inflict despair. When you would gain the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=17">fleeing</a> condition, you can choose to stand your ground and be <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=36">stunned</a> for the effect’s duration as well, preventing you from running and allowing you to re-enter the fight more quickly when the effect ends.&nbsp;</p>
