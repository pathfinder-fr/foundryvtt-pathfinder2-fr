------ Description (en) ------
<p>You gain your mystery's initial revelation spell (@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.2gQYrCPwBmwau26O]{Life Link}). Casting this spell progresses your @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ibX2EhKkyUtbOHLj]{Oracular Curse}. Use the minor curse from your mystery, but when you progress it again, instead of your mystery's moderate curse effect, you become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} in addition to the effects of the minor curse.</p>
<p>If you don't have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Refocus} by reconciling the conflicting nature of your mystery, which also reduces your curse to minor.</p>
<h4>Minor Curse of Life</h4>
<p>As your life force seeps outward, it becomes more difficult to keep your body functioning. Effects that restore Hit Points to you take a status penalty equal to half your level (minimum 1) to the number of HP you recover.</p>
