------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature fails or critically fails a save against your snare.</p>
<hr />
<p>Your snares are so befuddling that your victims rarely notice you slipping out of sight. If you have expert proficiency in Deception, you can Create a Diversion against the triggering creature. If you have expert proficiency in Intimidation, you can instead Demoralize the triggering creature. If you have both, choose one of the two effects.</p>
