<hr />
<p>You've mastered a defensive technique unique to the ancient dragons of Bloodsalt: beating your wings to create a billowing cloud of mist. You become momentarily @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} from the triggering attack if vision is the attacker's only precise sense. Normally this means the attacker must succeed at a <span data-pf2-check="flat" data-pf2-traits="hidden" data-pf2-label="Hidden Flat Check DC" data-pf2-dc="11" data-pf2-show-dc="owner">Flat Check</span> to target you.
