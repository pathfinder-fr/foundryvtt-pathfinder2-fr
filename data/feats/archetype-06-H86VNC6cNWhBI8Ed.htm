<p>You have sworn the Crimson Oath and become a full member of the Crimson Reclaimers. You gain expert proficiency in Stealth and Survival. Whenever you roll a success on a saving throw against an undead’s special ability, you get a critical success instead. This applies to any abilities that come from being undead, including an undead’s innate spells (but not its prepared or spontaneous spells).</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Knight Reclaimant archetype.&nbsp;</p>
