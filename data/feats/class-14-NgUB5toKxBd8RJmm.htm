<p>Your plans account for your foes’ resistances, enabling you to strike a telling blow. When you hit with a Strike on which you substituted your attack roll due to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.m0f2B7G9eaaTmhFL]{Devise a Strategem}, you ignore an amount of resistance equal to your Intelligence modifier for each resistance that applies against your attack.&nbsp;</p>
