<p>You surround yourself in a mantle of Rain-Scribe magic and Stride twice; difficult terrain does not reduce your Speed, even if the difficult terrain has been manipulated by magic. Your magic clears the difficult terrain in each square you entered; until your next turn, those squares aren’t difficult terrain for any creature walking through them (or are normal difficult terrain if they were previously greater difficult terrain).&nbsp;</p>
