------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your mother was a sea hag, granting you one sea-green or blue eye. You find comfort both in the sea and on the shore.</p>
<p>Whenever you roll a success on an Athletics check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.c8TGiZ48ygoSPofx]{Swim}, you get a critical success instead. If you end your turn in water without having succeeded at a Swim action that round, you don’t sink (but you might still be moved by the current).&nbsp;</p>
