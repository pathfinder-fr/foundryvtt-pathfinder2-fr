------ Description (en) ------
<p>You instinctively learn how to use a sword with just a few practice swings. You change one of the swords designated in your @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.AmFv3ClkAVRowHLI]{Tengu Weapon Familiarity} to a new one that you’re wielding, provided the sword meets the specifications of Tengu Weapon Familiarity. You can Interact to draw a sword as part of this activity, designating the sword as part of drawing it; disrupting that Interact action prevents you from designating it as one of your swords. This designation lasts until your next daily preparations.</p>
