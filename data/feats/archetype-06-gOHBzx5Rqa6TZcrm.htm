<hr>
<p>When you meet someone's gaze, they are unable to look away.</p>
<p>Choose one target creature. That creature must succeed at a Will save or be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.AdPVz7rbaVSRxHFg]{Fascinated} until the end of your next turn; the DC for this save is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If the creature succeeds at its save or its fascination ends due to a hostile action, it becomes temporarily immune to your Mesmerizing Gaze for 1 day.</p>
<p>When you select this feat, it gains either the arcane or occult trait; once you make this choice, you can't change it.</p>
