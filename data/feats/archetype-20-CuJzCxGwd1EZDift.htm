------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your mask carries the legacy of Verdant Spider, the Speaker of Needs, allowing you to deceive and outwit your foes. You can attempt to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.QNAVeNKtHA0EUw4X]{Feint} a target from up to 30 feet away, and if you succeed or critically succeed in your Feint attempt, the target of your Feint takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saving throws against your spells until the start of your next turn. If you don't have the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.sIeuPW0j39fTZm08]{Conceal Spell} feat, you gain it as a bonus feat, allowing you to disguise your spellcasting from others' eyes. If you already have the Conceal Spell feat, you can use Conceal Spell once per round as a free action instead of as a single action.</p>
