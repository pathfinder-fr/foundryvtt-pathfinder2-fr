------ Description (en) ------
<p>You have a literal sixth sense for ambient magic in your vicinity.</p>
<p>You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were always using a 1st-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gpzpAAAJ1Lza2JVl]{Detect Magic}</em> spell. This detects magic in your field of vision only.</p>
<p>When you @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek}, you gain the benefits of a 3rd-level <em>detect magic</em> spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.</p>
