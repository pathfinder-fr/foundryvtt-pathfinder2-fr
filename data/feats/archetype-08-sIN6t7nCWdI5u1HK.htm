<p>You purify a spirit by coaxing it to release its anguish in a final cathartic howl. This deals sonic damage to all creatures in a @Template[type:cone|distance:30], with a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classOrSpellDC)|basic:true] save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If you expend a spirit wisp, this deals [[/r {1d4}[sonic]]]{1d4 sonic damage} per level you have. If you expend a spirit remnant, this deals [[/r {1d6}[sonic]]]{1d6 sonic damage} per level of the incorporeal undead or haunt from which you gained the remnant.</p>
