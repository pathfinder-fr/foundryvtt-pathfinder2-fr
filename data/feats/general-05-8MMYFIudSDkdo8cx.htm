------ Description (en) ------
<p>There always seems to be a little rat around to carry messages for you. You can cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.yhz9fF69uwRhnHix]{Animal Messenger} once per day as a primal innate spell. When you do, the animal that responds is always a rat. If there are no rats within range, the spell is lost.</p>
