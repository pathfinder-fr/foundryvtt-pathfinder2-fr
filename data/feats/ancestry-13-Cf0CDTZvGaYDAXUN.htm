<p>You’ve spent many an evening learning songs and tales featuring calacas, death’s wandering minstrels. You dramatically unleash a stunning blast of sound by smashing an instrument you hold or belting out a discordant note. This has the effects of @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.BilnTGuXrof9Dt9D]{Synaptic Pulse}, but the effect is auditory rather than mental. The DC is either your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.</p>
