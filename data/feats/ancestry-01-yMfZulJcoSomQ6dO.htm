<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You are so attuned to the land that you can call forth a bolt of energy from your surroundings. When you gain this feat, select acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You can call to the land to cast the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gISYsBFby1TiXfBt]{Acid Splash} cantrip as an innate primal spell at will, except the spell has only verbal components and deals the type of damage you chose instead of acid damage; the spell gains the trait appropriate to its damage instead of the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=3">acid</a> trait. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.&nbsp;</span></p>
