------ Description (en) ------
<p>You siphon some of the power from an offensive hex you cast to direct it at a second target as well. If the next action you use is to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell} to cast a harmful hex with a single target, reduce its level by 2 (making it 2 levels lower than the maximum spell level you can cast). If you do, you can select a second target for that hex to affect.&nbsp;</p>
