------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per 10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A Strike would damage you.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You gained a terrain attunement benefit since the start of your most recent turn and that attunement matches the terrain you're in.</p>
<hr />
<p>You're so attuned to the land that it rises up to protect you from a potentially fatal blow in a seeming coincidence. For instance, a branch suddenly falls from a nearby tree to take the brunt of a sword swing or a surprising change of current disrupts an enemy's attack. You gain resistance to physical damage equal to double your level against the triggering Strike.</p>
