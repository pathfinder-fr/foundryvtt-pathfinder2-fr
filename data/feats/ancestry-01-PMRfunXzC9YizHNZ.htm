<p>Long ago, qlippoth marked someone in your lineage, most likely through their ancient runestones that dot Golarion’s surface. Yours is an old lineage, primordial and twisted, and you have a sense for similarly twisted things. You’re trained in Occultism. If you’re already trained in Occultism (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.hDGosy2ZTwnyctEP]{Oddity Identification} skill feat.</p>
