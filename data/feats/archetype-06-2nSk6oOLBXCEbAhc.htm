------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You fail (but don't critically fail) a saving throw against an effect with the visual trait.</p>
<hr>
<p>You cause your eyes to liquefy and run out of your eye sockets, leaving them empty. You get a success on the save against the triggering effect, but you are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} for the duration the effect would have had on a failure. At that time, your eyes regrow and your normal vision returns.</p>
