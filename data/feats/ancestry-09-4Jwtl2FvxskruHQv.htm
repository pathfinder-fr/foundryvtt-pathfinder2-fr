<p>You summon an aura of shimmering heat, flurrying snow, crashing waves, or swirling wind and lightning. For 1 minute, you gain @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealment} against creatures more than 5 feet away, and any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you suffers [[/r 1d12]] damage (basic Reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). At 13th and 17th level, this damage increases by 1d12. A veil may changeling deals fire damage, a snow may changeling deals cold damage, a brine may changeling deals bludgeoning damage and the effect gains the water trait, and a virga may changeling deals electricity damage.</p>
