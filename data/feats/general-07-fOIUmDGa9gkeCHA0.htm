<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>master in Perception</p>
<hr>
<p>You have refined your palate and have a discerning sense of taste that can detect abnormalities in the flavor and texture of food and beverages. When eating food or drinking a beverage, you automatically attempt to identify the ingredients, which might alert you to the presence of alterations or additives, such as poisons. The GM rolls a secret Perception check using the poison’s level to determine the DC; on a success, you learn that the food or drink was poisoned, but not the specific poison used.</p>
<p>If you lick or taste something while Investigating or attempting to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.1OagaWtBpVXExToo]{Recall Knowledge} to identify something, if the taste would provide relevant additional information (at the GM’s discretion), you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check.</p>
