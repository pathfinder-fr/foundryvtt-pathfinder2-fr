<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">When you terrorize your enemies, you also cause them painful mental distress. When you successfully <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=53">Demoralize</a> a foe, that foe takes 1d4 mental damage at the start of each of its turns as long as it remains <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=19">frightened</a> and continues to engage in combat with you. If you have master proficiency in <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=7">Intimidation</a>, the damage increases to 2d4, and if you have legendary proficiency, the damage increases to 3d4.&nbsp;</span></p>
