------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your spotter's quick signals help you make even difficult shots seem simple. As long as both you and your spotter can see the target of your attacks, you don't take a penalty for attacking within your weapon's second range increment. The penalty you take for firing into further range increments is -3 for the third range increment, with an additional -2 penalty for each additional increment beyond the third (-5 for the fourth range increment, -7 for the fifth, and -9 for the sixth).</p>
