The resistance you gain from Glimpse of Redemption against damage from an evil aberration is 7 + your level. If you use @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.IX1VlVCL5sFTptEE]{Liberating Step} triggered by an evil aberration, your ally gains a +4 circumstance bonus to checks granted by your Liberating Step, and the ally can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.UHpkTuCtyaPqiCAB]{Step} twice afterward.</p>
