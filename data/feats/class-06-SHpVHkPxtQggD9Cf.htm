<p>Your Swords training taught you to never lose hold of your weapon. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC when foes attempt to Disarm you. If you have the Deft Cooperation feat and critically succeed on a check to Aid an ally’s attack roll or skill check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus from Deft Cooperation (instead of a +1 bonus) the first time you attempt an attack roll or attempt a skill check where the bonus would apply.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Swordmaster archetype.&nbsp;</p>
