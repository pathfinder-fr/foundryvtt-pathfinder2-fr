<p>Your Swords training taught you to never lose hold of your weapon. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC when foes attempt to <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=41">Disarm</a> you. If you have the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=873">Deft Cooperation</a> feat and critically succeed on a check to <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=75">Aid</a> an ally’s attack roll or skill check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus from Deft Cooperation (instead of a +1 bonus) the first time you attempt an attack roll or attempt a skill check where the bonus would apply.<br><br><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Swordmaster archetype.&nbsp;</p>
