<p>Traditionally, fiends are exceptionally good at persuading people to do things, even when their targets know it’s a bad idea. You’re also rather good at it, compelling the weak and weak-willed to your bidding. You can cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.vLA0q0WOK2YPuJs6]{Charm}&nbsp;once per day as a 1st-level divine innate spell.</p>
