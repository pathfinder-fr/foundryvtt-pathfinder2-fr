<hr>
<p>Once you have penetrated a foe’s defenses, you can home in on the same spot to exploit your opponent’s wound and deal some serious damage. The second time you hit and deal damage with a melee axe Strike to the same opponent or object during your turn, you ignore half of the opponent’s or object’s Hardness, if any. If you hit and deal damage with a melee axe Strike to the same opponent or object a third or fourth time during your turn, you ignore all of its Hardness, if any.&nbsp;</p>
