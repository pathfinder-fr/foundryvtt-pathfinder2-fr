------ Description (en) ------
<p>You excel at watching your allies' backs and helping them watch yours. As long as you and an ally are adjacent to each other, neither of you can become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} due to flanking unless both of you are flanked. If you're adjacent to more than one ally, all eligible allies can benefit at a given time.</p>
<p>The benefit is negated for everyone if at least you and any one eligible ally are flanked, but not if your allies are flanked and you aren't.</p>
