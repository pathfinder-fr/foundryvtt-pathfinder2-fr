------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have a creature @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.VcDeM8A5oI6VqhbM]{Restrained}.</p>
<hr />
<p>Flexing your entire body, you heave your opponent over your head and slam them into the ground. Make an unarmed melee Strike against the creature you have grabbed or restrained; on a success, the target lands @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone}, and on a critical success, the target lands prone and takes an additional [[/r {2d6}[bludgeoning]]]{2d6 bludgeoning damage}. Regardless of whether the Strike is successful, you immediately release your hold on the target.</p>
