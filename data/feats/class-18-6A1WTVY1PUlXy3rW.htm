------ Description (en) ------
<p>You can channel the entire realm of possibilities of your spellbook into an attack.</p>
<p>Once during your daily preparations, you can use a spell slot to hold that infinite potential, rather than using it to prepare a spell. When you make a Spellstrike, you can expend this special spell slot to immediately prepare and cast a spell from your spellbook at 2 levels lower than the slot's level. (As normal for preparing spells, you can use a spell of an even-lower level, heightening it accordingly.)</p>
<p>You don't have any spell prepared in that slot until you cast from that slot.</p>
