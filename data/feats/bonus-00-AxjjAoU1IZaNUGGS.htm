------ Description (en) ------
<p>When you roll a success on a save against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. In addition, any time you gain the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened} condition, reduce the condition’s value by 1. As usual, this ability reduces the initial frightened condition by 1, so if you have multiple similar abilities, they don’t both take effect.</p>
