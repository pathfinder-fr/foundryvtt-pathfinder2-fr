<hr>
<p>You’ve sworn an oath to banish the corruption of fiends to the dark planes they call home. Add the following tenet to your champion’s code after the other tenets: “You must banish or slay fiends you come across as long as you have a reasonable chance of success; in the incredibly unlikely event you find a good fiend, you don’t have to banish or kill it.” Your Retributive Strike gains a +4 circumstance bonus to damage against a fiend, or a +6 circumstance bonus if you have master proficiency with the weapon you used. Your Glimpse of Redemption’s resistance against damage from a fiend is 7 + your level. If you use Liberating Step triggered by a fiend, your ally gains a +4 circumstance bonus to checks granted by your Liberating Step, and the ally can Step twice afterward. You don’t consider fiends to be legitimate authorities, even in nations ruled by fiends.</p>
