------ Description (en) ------
<p>It’s said that the flesh of the right side of a hyena can heal diseases, but that of the left side is poisonous. You can take [[/r 1 #damage]] damage to feed someone blood from your right side and Administer First Aid or take [[/r 2d8 #damage]] damage to Treat Disease or Treat Wounds; in either case, you don’t need healer’s tools, and gain a +1 item bonus. Blood from your left side causes the check to critically fail automatically.</p>
