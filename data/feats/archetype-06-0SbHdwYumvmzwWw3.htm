Make a single bludgeoning or piercing dynamo Strike and compare the attack roll result to the ACs of up to two foes. The first foe must be within your melee reach and the second foe must be adjacent to the first foe in a straight line away from you. Roll damage only once and apply it to each creature you hit.
