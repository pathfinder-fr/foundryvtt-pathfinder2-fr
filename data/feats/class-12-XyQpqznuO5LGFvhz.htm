<hr>
<p>With a sharp whistle or wave of your hands, you distract an opponent from the fact that one of your allies is about to attack them. Choose a target and an ally, both of whom must be within 30 feet. The target is <a class="entity-link" draggable="true" data-pack="pf2e.conditionitems" data-id="AJh5ex99aV6VTggg"><i class="fas fa-suitcase"></i> Flat-Footed</a> against the first Strike the ally makes on their next turn; if your ally doesn't Strike that target, the effect is lost. Depending on how you describe your distraction, this action gains either the auditory or visual trait. </p>
