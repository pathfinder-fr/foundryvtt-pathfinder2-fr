------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your inherent glory radiates into the world with all the divine power of the celestial planes for 1 minute.</p>
<p>Any creature that can see you while you Radiate Glory must attempt a Will saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> You are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} to the creature for 1 round by the shining light, but can’t use this concealment to Hide, as normal for when your location is obvious.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, except you are concealed to the creature while your glory radiates.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} to the creature while your glory radiates, lost amid the radiant corona of your presence. Your general position is still obvious, so you can’t use this to Sneak.</p>
