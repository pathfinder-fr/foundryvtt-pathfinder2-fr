<hr>
<p>You’ve learned how best to move in heavy armor. When wearing heavy armor, if you meet the Strength requirement, instead of reducing the movement penalty by 5 feet, you reduce the penalty by 10 feet (typically reducing the penalty to 0). If you are a dwarf with the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.C1R4wd6G46CAVIn7]{Unburdened Iron} feat, increase your Speed by 5 feet.&nbsp;</p>
