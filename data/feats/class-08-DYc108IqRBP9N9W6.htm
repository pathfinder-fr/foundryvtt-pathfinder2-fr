------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your muse has opened your senses to the world beyond. You gain spiritsense as an imprecise sense with a range of 60 feet.</p>
<p>Spiritsense enables you to sense the spirits of creatures, including living creatures, most non-mindless undead, and haunts within the listed range. As with your hearing and other imprecise senses, you still need to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} to locate an undetected creature.</p>
<p>As spiritsense detects spiritual essence, not physical bodies, it can detect spirits projected by spells such as @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.0873MWM0qKDDv81O]{Project Image} or possessing otherwise soulless objects. It can't detect soulless bodies, constructs, or objects, and like most senses, it doesn't penetrate through solid objects.</p>
