------ Description (en) ------
<p>You gain your mystery's initial revelation spell (@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.EzB9i7R6aBRAtJCh]{Tempest Touch}). Casting this spell progresses your @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ibX2EhKkyUtbOHLj]{Oracular Curse}. Use the minor curse from your mystery, but when you progress it again, instead of your mystery's moderate curse effect, you become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} in addition to the effects of the minor curse.</p>
<p>If you don't have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Refocus} by reconciling the conflicting nature of your mystery, which also reduces your curse to minor.</p>
<h4>Minor Curse of Tempests</h4>
<p>An aura of a whirling storm whips up in a 5-foot emanation around you and in your space. The aura puts out small non-magical fires 1 round after they're lit or brought into your aura.</p>
<p>Electrical energy builds up within your storm, turning you into a lightning rod; you gain weakness 2 to electricity, and electricity spells or effects that have additional effects for a creature wearing or holding metal treat you as though you were wearing metal.</p>
