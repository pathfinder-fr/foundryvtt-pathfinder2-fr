<p>Your Firebrand training has taught you that achieving something is more satisfying if you boast about it first. You declare a boast about a particular skill action, such as <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=28">Balance</a>, <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=53">Demoralize</a>, or <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=26">Recall Knowledge</a>. The first time you attempt this action within the next minute in a context the GM deems both suitably challenging and meaningful, you must roll twice and use the lower result. If you succeed at this check, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to attempt the same action for 10 minutes. If you fail this check or don’t attempt the action within 1 minute, you instead take a –1 circumstance penalty on checks to attempt the same action for 1 hour.<br><br>If the chosen action can be used with multiple skills, such as <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=24">Identify Magic</a> or Recall Knowledge, you must specify which skill you are using for that particular action, such as using <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=2">Arcana</a> to Identify Magic, and your bonus or penalty after the boast applies only to checks using that skill for that action. Once you declare a boast about a particular action, you cannot declare a boast about the same action until the next time you make daily preparations, regardless of whether you succeed or fail at the check.<br><br>Typically a challenging task is one with at least a standard DC for your level, though the difficulty may be higher depending on the situation. A meaningful context is one where the action’s success or failure is relevant to the pursuit of your goals, rather than a boast you made simply to gain a bonus later.<br><br><strong>Special</strong> You can’t select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Firebrand Braggart archetype.&nbsp;</p>
