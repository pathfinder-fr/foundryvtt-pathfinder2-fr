Name: Walk The Plank
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>You frighten a foe into moving where you want them, traditionally demanding they walk the plank. Attempt to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.2u915NdUyQan6uKF]{Demoralize} an opponent; this check gains the incapacitation trait.</p>
<p>On a success, in addition to the normal effects, you can also force the target to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Bcxarzksqt9ezrs6]{Stride} up to its Speed. You choose the path the target takes, and it does so as part of your Walk the Plank action. You can't force the target to move into a harmful space (one where it will take damage, fall, provoke reactions, or similar) unless the result of your check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.2u915NdUyQan6uKF]{Demoralize} was a critical success.</p>
<p>The target then becomes temporarily immune to Walk the Plank for 24 hours.</p>
