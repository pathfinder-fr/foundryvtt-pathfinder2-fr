------ Description (en) ------
<p>You’ve learned to bind some of your feathers together into a fan to focus your ancestral magic. You gain a <em>tengu feather fan</em>: a magic item of light Bulk with a level equal to your level and the evocation and primal traits. You (and only you) can use the <em>tengu feather fan</em> to cast tengu magic. If your fan is lost or destroyed, you can create a replacement during your daily preparations; if you do so, your previous fan falls apart into mundane feathers. Further feats might grant you additional activations of your <em>tengu feather fan</em>, but you can never have more than three activations per day, no matter how many such feats you have. The DC for spells you cast with your <em>tengu feather fan</em> is your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.You can cast the 1st-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.g8QqHpv2CWDwmIm1]{Gust of Wind}&nbsp;spell by activating your <em>tengu feather fan</em>.</p>
