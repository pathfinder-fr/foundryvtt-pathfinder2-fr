<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per 10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An enemy's Strike against you is a critical hit.</p>
<hr />
<p>You collapse into a pile of bones, mitigating the worst of the damage you would have taken, and the triggering attack deals only the amount it would deal on a hit (typically full damage instead of double damage). Any other effects caused by a critical hit still occur. While collapsed, you're @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} and can't act except to Stand, which re-forms you into a skeleton in a standing position.</p>
