<hr>
<p>Even other halflings consider you to be particularly lucky. You can use Halfling Luck once per hour, rather than once per day. If you have <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=62">Guiding Luck</a>, you can still use Halfling Luck when you fail a Perception check or attack roll only once per day (though you can use it within the same hour that you used Halfling Luck), and if you have <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=1021">Helpful Halfling</a>, you can still use Halfling Luck on an ally instead of yourself only once per day.&nbsp;</p>
