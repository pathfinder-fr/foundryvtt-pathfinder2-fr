------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your lineage descends from devils, the conniving schemers of Hell’s malevolent hierarchy. You’re as skilled at noticing lies and twisted wordings as you are at constructing them.</p>
<p>You are trained in Deception and Legal Lore. If you were already trained in Deception (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Dvz54d6aPhjsmUux]{Lie To Me} skill feat.</p>
