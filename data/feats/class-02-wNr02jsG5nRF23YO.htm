------ Description (en) ------
<p>You have a keen sense for avoiding spurious lines of inquiry. When you @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.xTK2zsWFyxSJvYbX]{Pursue a Lead}, the GM tells you if the lead you chose is inconsequential.</p>
<p>For example, if you found a splatter of gray mud on the wall, thought it was suspicious, and Pursued it as a Lead, the GM would tell you if there was no greater mystery related to it.</p>
<p>When the GM tells you a lead is inconsequential, you can decline to Pursue the Lead, keeping any leads you were already pursuing. You still can't use Pursue a Lead again for 10 minutes, as normal.</p>
