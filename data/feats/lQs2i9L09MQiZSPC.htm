<hr>
<p>You’ve learned to mimic the abilities of spellcasters by studying their flourishes and words. When you activate a magic item to generate a spell effect, attempt a Deception check. If you succeed against an onlooker’s Perception DC, to that onlooker, you appear to <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=72">Cast that Spell</a> instead. Onlookers who successfully <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=834">Recognize the Spell</a> realize you used a magic item, though those who later successfully <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=24">Identify the Magic</a> still can’t determine that the source of the effect was a magic item.</p>
