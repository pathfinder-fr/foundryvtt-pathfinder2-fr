<p>You draw in the moisture from nearby creatures, draining them dry to heal your wounds. Creatures in a @Template[type:cone|distance:30] take [[/r {6d8}[negative]]] negative damage, with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classOrSpellDC)|basic:true] save against your class DC. A creature that critically fails this saving throw is also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1}. As long as at least one creature was damaged by your Desiccating Inhalation, you regain HP equal to your level.</p>
<p>At 14th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d8. [[/r floor(@actor.level/2)d8[negative]]]{level based damage}</p>
