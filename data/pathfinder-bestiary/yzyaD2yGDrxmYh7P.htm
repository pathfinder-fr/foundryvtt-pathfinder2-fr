------ Description (en) ------
The tradition of astrology and looking to the stars for both navigation and prognostication is well-established in iruxi society, and their wise and observant stargazers are among the people’s most respected members. Even the lowliest stargazer, as presented here, has a number of useful primal spells to aid their kin; in larger iruxi settlements, stargazers wield even greater powers.<br><br>
