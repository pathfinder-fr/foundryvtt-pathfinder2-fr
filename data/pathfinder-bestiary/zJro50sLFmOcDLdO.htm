------ Description (en) ------
These shapeless masses of quivering flesh are the least of devilkind. Pathetic creatures from Hell’s first layer, lemures roam alongside damned and suffering souls. Pit fiends can combine the essence of a mob of lemures to concentrate their collective wickedness with a single form, granting it an infernal sentience and transforming it into a more powerful devil .<br><br>
