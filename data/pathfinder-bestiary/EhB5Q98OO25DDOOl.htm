------ Description (en) ------
The lizardfolk defender serves as a protector of the young, guardian of the settlement, and when no other options are available, soldier in time of war. They eagerly rise to the defense of their kin but do not revel in battle. An iruxi defender would rather turn back intruders and allow them to flee with the knowledge they were beaten, in hopes that such word prevents further invasions, but they are not naive. The iruxi understand the need for revenge, and when they allow a foe to escape, they do not forget.<br><br>
