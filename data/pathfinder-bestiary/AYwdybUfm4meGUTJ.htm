------ Description (en) ------
Giant rats are enormous versions of the common vermin. They are typically found in abundant numbers, but since they cannot flt in the nooks where mundane rats typically hide, they are much easier to locate and exterminate. They mostly live in sewers where they can scavenge from the streets above, but some families of giant rats live in more remote locations, such as dank caves or forests and hills. Rats are incredibly adept survivors and can be found nearly anywhere in the world, though they tend to favor temperate or warm climates as opposed to cold regions.<br><br> Although its bite alone is not lethal except to the very young or very old, the giant rat carries the filth fever common to rodents around the world—a pestilence more than capable of ravaging rural communities.<br><br>
