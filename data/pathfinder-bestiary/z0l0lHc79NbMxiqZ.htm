------ Description (en) ------
Some goblins take their people’s admiration of fire fully into the realm of deadly obsession. These pyromaniacs can be a great boon to a band of goblin raiders eager to torch their enemies and wreak havoc. More often, however, their presence is a double-edged sword; in the heat of the moment, goblin pyros sometimes lose sight of their tribe’s goals and simply set fire to anything that will burn—including their own allies.<br><br>
