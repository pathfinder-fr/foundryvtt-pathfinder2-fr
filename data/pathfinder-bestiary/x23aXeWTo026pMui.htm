------ Description (en) ------
Earth mephits are humorless and trudge about their tasks with little enthusiasm. They are somewhat more stout than other mephits, and their dark-brown or gray bodies are always coated with layers of dirt and filth. An earth mephit can fly, just as any other mephit, but the act of flight is uncomfortable and unnerving to them—they rarely ascend higher than 5 feet off the ground if they can help it.<br><br>
