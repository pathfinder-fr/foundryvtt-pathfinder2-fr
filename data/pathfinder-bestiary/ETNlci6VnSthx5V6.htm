------ Description (en) ------
Erinyes exact vengeance and bloody justice for a creature’s crimes, torturing and punishing their victims in ironic fashion before allowing them the escape of death. While an erinys appears as a fallen angel and the first erinyes shared that origin, erinyes now originate in myriad ways, some promoted from lesser devils and others shaped from lemures themselves forged from the souls of torturers and persecutors. The erinyes’ origin is entwined with Eiseth, herself a fallen angel and one of Hell’s most powerful demigods. The first erinyes were all considered to be Eiseth’s metaphorical daughters, but erinyes formed since that time are no longer limited to a single gender.<br><br>
