------ Description (en) ------
Although the glistening scales and sleek, fin-like wings on these drakes give them an appearance reminiscent of river   sh, they are actually distant relatives of the black dragon. While smaller than most drakes, river drakes are more than capable of plaguing river travelers and are equally at home above and below the water’s surface. This flexibility allows them to catch a wide variety of prey, from fish and boggards to deer and the occasional ferry passenger.<br><br>
