------ Description (en) ------
These large birds of prey swoop down from incredible heights to snatch fish and small mammals in their powerful talons. Eagles nest atop high trees or steep cliffs that provide a commanding view of the surrounding area. They avoid nesting too near civilization, but some remote cultures train eagles as hunting companions.<br><br>
