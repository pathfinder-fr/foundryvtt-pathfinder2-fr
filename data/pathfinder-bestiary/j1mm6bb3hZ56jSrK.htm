------ Description (en) ------
Grigs are kindly musicians of the fey, often getting themselves into trouble due to their penchant for confronting evil well beyond their ability to vanquish. Even so, they fight bravely and with great cunning, using their magic and ranged sonic attacks while flying and leaping using their wings and powerful cricket-like lower torsos to stay out of reach.<br><br>
