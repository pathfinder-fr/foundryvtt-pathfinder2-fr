------ Description (en) ------
The typical kobold trains with agile weaponry, favoring the light pick for its use in crafting new tunnels to expand their domains through underground reaches. Kobolds are capable of landing sneaky strikes against unsuspecting foes but are just as quick to scamper off to safety when they don’t, as a group, outnumber their enemies at least two to one.<br><br>
