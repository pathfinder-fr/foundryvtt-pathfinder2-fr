------ Description (en) ------
Friendly, curious, and eternally optimistic, lantern archons embody the virtue of hope. They are formed of living light given corporeal shape, and they serve as beacons, guiding mortals out of their darkest moments and toward the path of righteousness. Their luminous bodies can  icker with the subtlety of a candle flame or flare up like a torch. Lantern archons can control all aspects of their light as easily as other creatures control their facial expressions, leading them to change color, twinkle, and otherwise dim and brighten in time with their actions and words. While effervescent and chipper in conversation, lantern archons are impressively stoic mobile support troops and guardians in times of con ict, and are capable of uniting to form powerful warriors of light called gestalts.<br><br>
