------ Description (en) ------
Air mephits are capricious and flighty relative to their kin; they are as likely to fly blindly into battle as they are to whine in terror at a loud noise. They are pale blue in coloration and have thin wings that trail small puffs of vapor as they fly through the skies.<br><br>
