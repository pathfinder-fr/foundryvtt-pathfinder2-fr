------ Description (en) ------
<p>While all goblins enjoy singing, goblin war chanters pride themselves on mastering the art of vocal performance. Their ballads and jingles are undeniably catchy, though whether they are actually enjoyable is entirely subjective.</p>
<hr />
<p>These small humanoids have green or gray skin and large heads with wide ears. While some goblins are civilized and have worked hard to be considered upstanding members of humanoid communities, most are impetuous and vicious creatures who delight in wreaking havoc. These goblins think nothing of slaughtering livestock, stealing infants, or burning down a building purely for momentary delight. They revel in playing malicious tricks on taller humanoids, whom they call "longshanks."</p>
<p>Goblins are superstitious, with an intense awe of magic and a fascination with fire; goblins who master magic or fire earn great respect from their kin. Most other humanoids find it difficult to understand goblins' outlook: they hate canines but eagerly share their lairs with so-called "goblin dogs," they fearlessly attack larger creatures but are terrified of horses, and they despise vegetables yet consider pickles a delicacy. To a goblin, of course, these are all perfectly sensible life choices.</p>

Bien que tous les gobelins aiment chanter, les Chantres de guerre s’enorgueillissent de maîtriser l’art de la performance vocale. Leurs ballades et ritournelles sont indéniablement entraînantes mais quant à savoir si elles sont agréables, tout est une question de point de vue.
