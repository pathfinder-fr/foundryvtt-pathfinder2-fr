------ Description (en) ------
Wargs hunt in packs and surround their prey like common wolves, but their cunning and penchant for taunting victims makes them easy to distinguish from their less-intelligent cousins. But despite their intelligence, wargs have simple desires for food and shelter, making them easy for evil humanoids such as orcs and hobgoblins to recruit to protect their camps or join them in battle. Most wargs are amenable to this arrangement, but if food should run out, wargs are more than willing to integrate goblinoid flesh into their diet.<br><br>
