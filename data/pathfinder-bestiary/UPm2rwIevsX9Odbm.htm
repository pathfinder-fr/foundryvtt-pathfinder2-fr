------ Description (en) ------
Grikkitogs, also known as “hungry earth,” are strange parasites from the Plane of Earth that infest and possess earth, rock, and stone in order to feed their endless hunger. A young grikkitog is a formless apparition until it corrupts an earth elemental host, forming the grikkitog’s core. A grikkitog can then infest the earth and stone nearby with its voracious essence, forming maws and eyes all around it. These creatures are particularly dangerous to small creatures that lair within gaps and holes among rocks, as well as mountain climbers searching for the perfect handhold.<br><br>
