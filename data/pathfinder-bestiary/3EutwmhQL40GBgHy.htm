------ Description (en) ------
Other proteans don’t consider the flying, iridescent beings known as voidworms to be part of a protean caste at all, but instead merely a shameful side effect of the Maelstrom’s constantly churning energy. To call a voidworm a protean in the presence of a more powerful protean is as sure a way to instigate combat as any.<br><br> Voidworms themselves have little interest in whether anyone sees them as proteans. They maintain a thriving ecology in the Maelstrom, frolicking in schools of up to 20 and playing in the chaos of constantly shifting realities. Elsewhere , voidworms are mesmerized by the principle of object permanence; many latch onto specific features of a region  and flit through the air around it for months or even years as they wait for the object of their curiosity to change. Minor changes— such as a tree’s change of color in the fall, a corpse’s slow decay, or periodic venting of steam from a geyser—all fascinate voidworms. A voidworm is about 2 feet long and weighs 2 pounds.<br><br>
