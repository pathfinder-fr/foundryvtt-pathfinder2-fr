------ Description (en) ------
Alchemy intrigues many duergars, and their cruel traditions often motivate them to experiment on slaves. Eager to inflict pain and justify the abuse as a method of expanding knowledge, duergar bombardiers often accompany slaver bands so they can have the first chance to select their next test subjects from captured victims. To duergar bombardiers, the lob of each bomb represents a new opportunity to observe how their targets react and record the results to enhance future modifications to their alchemical concoctions.<br><br>
