------ Description (en) ------
Naiad queens rule over pristine wildernesses centered on untouched lakes or other bodies of fresh water. Bards’ songs and artists’ paintings of nymphs tend to depict naiad queens in their slightly more humanoid forms, which they don when they make the rare journey into civilized lands to garner allies or gauge threats.<br><br> Most naiad queens treat those who respect their domains with kindness, but they are fierce and quick in eliminating foes. Their blinding beauty and breadth of offensive spells make naiad queens fierce opponents if forced into a fight.<br><br>
