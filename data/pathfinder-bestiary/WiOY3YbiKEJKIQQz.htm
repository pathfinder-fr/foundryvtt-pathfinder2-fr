------ Description (en) ------
Stone giants are stoic, reclusive herders and artists who have a rich history and collection of traditions. They dwell in caves in tall mountains and craggy ranges, where their grayish skin allows them to blend in with their surroundings and go unnoticed by imperceptive adventurers. Those benign travelers who come across a tribe of stone giants need not worry much, however, for stone giants do not actively invite confrontation or strife. They are, by and large, a peaceful people who seek wisdom through exploration of nature and long meditations on the elements of the natural world. Their elders are the wisest of stone giants, and use their charisma and druidic magic to lead their tribes to prosperity and harmony with nature.<br><br> A typical stone giant stands 12 feet in height and weighs about 1,500 pounds.
