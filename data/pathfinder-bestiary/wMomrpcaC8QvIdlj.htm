Name: Ankhrav
Nom: 
État: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
These horse-sized, burrowing monsters generally avoid heavily settled areas like
cities, but ankhravs’ predilection for livestock and humanoid flesh ensures that
the creatures do not remain in the deep wilderness for long. Desperate farmers
whose fields become infested by ankhravs often have little recourse but to seek
the aid of adventurers.<br><br>
