------ Description (en) ------
Among the most powerful of all the true aeons, pleromas are a manifestation of the duality of creation and destruction. Their physical manifestation is a constant state of  ux between these two poles, their forms a shifting cloak of black where galaxies and other celestial objects  it in and out of existence, as if depicting the constant life, death, and rebirth of a miniature, self-contained universe.<br><br>Pleromas see the multiverse as both eternal and cyclical, doomed and malleable, ending only if these cycles ever become unbalanced. They believe the current Convergence is necessary to obtain this essential balance, and act to ensure that the grand design of the Monad is carried out to the smallest detail.<br><br>
