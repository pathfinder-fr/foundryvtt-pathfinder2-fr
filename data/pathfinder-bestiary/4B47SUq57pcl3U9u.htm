------ Description (en) ------
Despite their flaming blades and heavy armor, legion archons are the diplomats of peace among the archons, preferring justice via compromise and mutual benefit rather than justice by the sword. Nonetheless, when forced to fight against fiendish powers—especially fiends that embody the sin of wrath—legion archons don’t hesitate in battle, mounting offensives under divine commanders like Iomedae.<br><br>
