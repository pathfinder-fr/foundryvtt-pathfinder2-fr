------ Description (en) ------
These skull-headed, vulture-winged daemons are harbingers of pestilence and servants of their patron Horseman, Apollyon. Manifestations of evil souls who perished from disease in life, leukodaemons work tirelessly to spread disease across all the worlds of the multiverse. More than any other daemon, leukodaemons cooperate with each other and those who conjure them to mortal worlds to spread sickness and plague, eschewing personal glory for end results.<br><br>
