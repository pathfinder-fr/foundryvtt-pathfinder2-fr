------ Description (en) ------
Although the typical vampire bat has a wingspan of 7 inches and doesn’t pose a significant threat to larger prey alone , some unusually aggressive species of these bats hunt in deadly swarms. A churning cloud of vampire bats is much more dangerous than the sum of its individual parts and is capable of inflicting an overwhelming number of bleeding wounds in a frighteningly short span of time.<br><br>
