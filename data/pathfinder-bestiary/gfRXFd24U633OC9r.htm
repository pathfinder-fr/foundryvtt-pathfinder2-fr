------ Description (en) ------
Jinkins are sadistic tinkers who steal and sabotage items and take great pride in their power to curse precious objects. They hold grudges and create convoluted plans for revenge whenever they feel slighted, such as when a creature dares to remove one of their curses. Rarely content to wreak simple mayhem, jinkins also take immense pleasure in torture and murder, though they prefer to lead victims into traps designed to capture or incapacitate rather than kill outright. Deep pits are favorites, since victims who survive the fall face a slow death from starvation and thirst. Jinkins enjoy gathering at the edge of pits to mock, tease, and torment.<br><br>
