------ Description (en) ------
Hyaenodons are the ferocious primeval cousins of the smaller hyena. Looming, shaggy-furred creatures nearly the size of a horse, hyaenodons are truly formidable predators to be reckoned with, due both to their size and to their bone-crushing jaws. Gnoll clans find these creatures particularly useful as mounts and guardians.<br><br>
