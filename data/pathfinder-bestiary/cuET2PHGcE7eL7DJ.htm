Name: Marid
Nom: 
État: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
Marids are capricious but powerful genies from the Plane of Water; among geniekind, they are rivaled in power only by the fiery efreet. Marids embody the strength of the ocean’s waves and currents, but they also have a gentler side, loving performance and art such as dancing, music, and storytelling.<br>Marids regard efreet with hostility but rarely encounter them in their native environment. They get along with djinn, jann, and shaitans, although the latter consider marids flighty and annoying, associating only long enough to close trade deals. Marid society has strict rules of hospitality, and many marid cities have a magically sealed foreign quarter where marid shahzadas conduct business with air-breathers.<br><br>
