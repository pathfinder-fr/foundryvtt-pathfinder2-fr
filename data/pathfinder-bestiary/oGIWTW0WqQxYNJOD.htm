------ Description (en) ------
A nosoi resembles a whippoorwill, sparrow, or other small bird wearing a heavy leather plague doctor’s mask. They are the clerks, messengers, and scribes of the Boneyard, witnessing judgments, directing souls, and generally performing the administrative grunt work that keeps the Boneyard functioning. Most nosois are particularly chatty and eager to discuss how important they consider their individual assignments to be.<br><br>
