------ Description (en) ------
Jann are genies composed of all four elements, meaning they are not quite home on any of the Elemental Planes. Instead, jann reside on the Material Plane, making only brief forays to the other parts of the Inner Sphere. Although they are human in size and appearance, jann are not at all related to humans and bristle at any claims to this effect. They are a proud people and take great care to maintain their honor—restoring that honor with the edge of a sword, if necessary.<br><br>
