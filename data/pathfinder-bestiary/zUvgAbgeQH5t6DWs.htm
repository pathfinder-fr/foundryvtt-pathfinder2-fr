------ Description (en) ------
<p>Choral angels are incredible singers who fill the halls of Nirvana with pious chants and sacred hymns. They form from the souls of talented bards and other performers. While they shy away from conflict, they occasionally brave the mortal realm to deliver good omens and auspicious messages. Choral angels often serve the goddess Shelyn, but they can also serve other good deities and empyreal lords.</p>
<hr />
<p>The celestial hosts of angels are messengers and warriors, divided into choirs based on their abilities and purviews. The majority of angels are neutral good and live in Nirvana, the plane of virtue and enlightenment. However, some angels, including several angelic deities, have different alignments, and some even dwell on other planes. Regardless of alignment, angels remain benevolent messengers possessed with magical auras to aid their allies.</p>
