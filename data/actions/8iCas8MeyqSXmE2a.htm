------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You fall asleep within 5 miles of Xarwin Manor.</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per 12 hours</p>
<hr />
<p>While you sleep, you experience dreams that verge on nightmares. In these dreams, your mind drifts from your soul, and everything you know feels like it’s being drawn up into the dark places between the stars to be devoured. During the dream, you can concentrate on one research topic you’ve unlocked that you haven’t fully investigated. If you choose a topic for which the party has already discovered all research thresholds, you can immediately switch to a different topic.</p>
<p>The skill you use and the DC for the check depend on the topic, as detailed in that topic’s Dreams venue. If you’re not dreaming within the manor grounds, the spiritual link to the malevolence is lessened and you take a –2 status penalty to the check.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You gain 2 RP.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> You gain 1 RP.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You peer too far into the malevolence, which notices your attempt. You manage to break the mental link just before you lose some memories to its ravenous appetite. Increase your malevolence condition value by 1.</p>
