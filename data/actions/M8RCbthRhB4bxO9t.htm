------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Trigger </strong>An enemy within 15 feet damages you.</p>
<hr>
<p>You put an impertinent foe who dared harm you in their&nbsp;proper place. You command your enemy to kneel before&nbsp;you in obedience. If they dare to refuse, they must pay the&nbsp;price in pain and anguish. The foe must choose one of the&nbsp;following options.</p>
<ul>
<li>The enemy kneels, dropping @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone} as a free action.</li>
<li>The enemy refuses, and you deal 1d6 mental damage to it. This damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at&nbsp;9th level, 4d6 at 12th level, 5d6 at 16th level, and 6d6&nbsp;at 19th level.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, your @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strikes} against the triggering creature deal 1 extra damage until the end of your next turn. You choose whether the damage type is evil or negative each time you use this reaction. This extra damage increases to 2 at 9th level and 3 at 16th level.</p>
