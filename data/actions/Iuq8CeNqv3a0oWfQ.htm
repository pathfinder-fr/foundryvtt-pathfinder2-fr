<p><strong>Trigger</strong> The spell's target would take damage;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> Reduce the triggering damage by 10, but you lose 5 Hit Points. Even if this reduces the damage to 0, the target still takes any effects that would come with the damage, such as the poison on a viper's fangs Strike.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The reaction reduces the damage by another 10, and you lose 5 more Hit Points. If you want to lose fewer Hit Points, you can choose to lower the damage reduction and HP lost to what any lower-level version of the spell could do without lowering the spell's actual level.</p>
