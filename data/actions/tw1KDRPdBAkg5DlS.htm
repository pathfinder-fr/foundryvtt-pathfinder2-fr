------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You're wielding a two-handed firearm or two-handed crossbow.</p>
<hr />
<p>You push outward with your weapon to clear some space before quickly reloading a fresh round. You make an Athletics check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.7blmbDrQFNfdT731]{Shove} an opponent within your reach using your weapon, then Interact to reload. For this Shove, you don't need a free hand, and you add the weapon's item bonus on attack rolls (if any) to the Athletics check. If your last action was a ranged Strike with the weapon, use the same multiple attack penalty as that Strike for the Shove; the Shove still counts toward your multiple attack penalty on further attacks as normal.</p>
