<p><strong>Requirements</strong> Legendary in Crafting</p>
<hr />
<p>You use legendary Vudran techniques to craft a disharmonic instrument that incorporates pieces of Kothogaz's heart. This is likely a tanpura, but legends mention other instruments and even voice enhancers. A disharmonic instrument is a virtuoso musical instrument.</p>
<p>This activity requires seven disharmonic heartslivers, the formula for a disharmonic instrument, 55,000 gp worth of rare materials, and 7 days of work. At the end of the 7 days, attempt a @Check[type:crafting|dc:40|traits:action:craft] check to Craft.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You masterfully complete the disharmonic instrument. Holding the instrument grants immunity to Kothogaz's tympanic heartbeat and many-eyed blight.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> You complete the disharmonic instrument.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> You don't complete the disharmonic instrument, and you contract many-eyed blight from the heartslivers.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, and whenever you're on the same plane as Kothogaz, it can immediately teleport to you with its Disharmonic Door ability.</p>
