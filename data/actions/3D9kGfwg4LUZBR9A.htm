<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p>
<hr />
<p>Temporarily cranking the gizmos on your body into overdrive, you try to add greater power to your attacks. Attempt a <span data-pf2-check="crafting" data-pf2-dc="@self.level" data-dc-visibility="all">Crafting check</span> that has a standard DC for your level.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Your gizmos go into a state of incredible efficiency called critical overdrive, adding great power to your attacks. Your Strikes deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier for 1 minute. After the Overdrive ends, your gizmos become unusable as they cool down or reset, and you can't use Overdrive for 1 minute.</p>

<p><strong>Success</strong> Your gizmos go into overdrive, adding power to your attacks. As critical success, except the additional damage is equal to half your Intelligence modifier.</p>

<p><strong>Failure</strong> You make a miscalculation and nothing happens.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Whoops! Something explodes. You take fire damage equal to your level, and you can't use Overdrive again for 1 minute as your gizmos cool down and reset.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Special</strong> When under the effects of Overdrive, you can still use the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.3D9kGfwg4LUZBR9A]{Overdrive} action. You can't extend your Overdrive's duration this way, but you can turn an overdrive into a critical overdrive if you critically succeed. A failure has no effect on your current Overdrive, and you end your Overdrive on a critical failure.</p>
