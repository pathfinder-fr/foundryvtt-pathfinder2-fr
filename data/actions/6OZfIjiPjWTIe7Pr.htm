<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You're wielding a loaded firearm or loaded crossbow.</p>
<hr />
<p>You go into a vicious spin, smashing your weapon into those nearby and increasing your momentum by firing. All creatures adjacent to you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage plus your Strength modifier; this increases to 2d6 if your firearm has a striking rune, 3d6 if it has a greater striking rune, and 4d6 if it has a major striking rune. This ability does not apply other effects that increase damage with your firearm Strikes such as weapon specialization. Creatures affected by this attack must attempt a basic Reflex save. A creature that fails its save is also pushed 5 feet directly away from you.</p>
