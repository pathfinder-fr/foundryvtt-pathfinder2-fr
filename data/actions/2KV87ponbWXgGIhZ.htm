<p>You and your eidolon act as one. Either you or your eidolon takes an action or activity using the same number of actions as Act Together, and the other takes a single action.</p>
<p>For example, if you spent 2 actions to Act Together, you could cast <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.y6rAdMK6EFlV6U0t]{Burning Hands}</em> (2 actions) and your eidolon could Strike (1 action), or your eidolon could use its Breath Weapon (2 actions) and you could Stride (1 action).</p>
<p>This lets you each use separate exploration activities like @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.IE2nThCmoyhQA0Jn]{Avoid Notice} as you travel.</p>
