------ Description (en) ------
<p>When it comes to a big heist, every rogue worth their salt&nbsp;knows that magic can throw meticulous plans into chaos,&nbsp;whether in the form of arcane wards or pesky divinations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You dabble in magic just enough to help handle these&nbsp;problems by jury-rigging spells and throwing a bit of&nbsp;your own magic into the mix. You might be a solitary&nbsp;thief, performing burglaries that can’t be explained by&nbsp;skill alone, or a specialist called in by other rogues to&nbsp;deal with magical security measures. You might even be&nbsp;on the up-and-up, hired to test magical defenses or even&nbsp;build them yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choose a multiclass archetype that has a basic, expert,&nbsp;and master spellcasting feat. You gain that archetype’s&nbsp;dedication feat as a bonus feat even though you don’t&nbsp;meet its level prerequisite, though you must meet its&nbsp;other prerequisites. For you, the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.mxO7u59ms58q7zyj]{Magical Trickster} rogue feat has a prerequisite of 2nd level instead of 4th level. You can choose the spellcasting&nbsp;ability score for the multiclass archetype you chose as&nbsp;your key ability score.</p>
