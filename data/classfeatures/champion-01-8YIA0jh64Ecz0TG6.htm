After the tenets of evil, add this tenet.</p>
<p>• Subvert or corrupt everything in your path that&nbsp;is pure and good, and sow doubt among those&nbsp;upholding such ideals.</p>
<p><strong>DIVINE SMITE 9TH</strong></p>
<p>Your champion’s reaction improves as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Desecrator: </strong>If your Charisma modifier is +2 or greater,&nbsp;your resistance against the triggering damage equals your&nbsp;Charisma modifier + half your level</p>
<p><strong>EXALT 11TH</strong></p>
<p>Your champion’s reaction improves in the following&nbsp;ways when you gain the exalt class feature at 11th level.&nbsp;These affect enemies rather than allies, as they exalt&nbsp;your dark god to bring pain upon your foes instead of&nbsp;uplifting your companions.</p>
<p><strong>Desecrator:</strong> When you use Selfish Shield, each enemy within 15 feet of you takes a –1 status penalty to attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.</p>
