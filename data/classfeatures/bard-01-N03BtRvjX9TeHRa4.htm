Name: Warrior (Bard Muse)
Nom: 
État: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>The battlefield is your stage, the clang of steel, your song.&nbsp;Your muse engages in countless battles, whether reveling&nbsp;in combat or resigned to its necessity. If your muse is a&nbsp;creature, it might be an otherworldly soldier, such as a&nbsp;planetar, archon, cornugon, or purrodaemon. If it’s a deity,&nbsp;it might be Gorum. As a bard with a warrior muse, you train&nbsp;for battle in addition to performance, and you prepare&nbsp;your allies for the dangers of battle. You might even wade&nbsp;into the thick of things with them.</p>
<p>You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.q1iP3SjAF5uceI0M]{Martial Performance} feat and add @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.4koZzrnMXhhosn0D]{Fear} to your spell repertoire.</p>
