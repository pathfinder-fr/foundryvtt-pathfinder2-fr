------ Description (en) ------
<p>The never-ending flow of positive energy within living beings is palpable to you. You might uphold the sanctity of life, or perhaps you seek to undermine it. You might draw power from the collective vitality of the world's living creatures, hold some connection to the Positive Energy Plane, or revere a collection of deities including Irori, Pharasma, Sarenrae, and the god of medicine Qi Zhong.</p>
<h3>Curse of Outpouring Life</h3>
<p>Life energy flows outward from you and connects you to all living things, but you expend your vital essence to do so. Your presence comforts the ill and injured, causes scars to fade slightly, spurs new growth in plants, and otherwise infuses your surroundings with vitality.</p>
