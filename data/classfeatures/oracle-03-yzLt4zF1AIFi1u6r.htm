Name: Signature Spells (Oracle)

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Experience enables you to cast some spells more flexibly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of&nbsp;that level to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn&nbsp;heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead,&nbsp;you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a&nbsp;signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you&nbsp;can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning&nbsp;those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you&nbsp;can replace it with any spell you could have chosen when&nbsp;you first selected it (i.e., of the same spell level or lower).&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also retrain specifically to change a signature&nbsp;spell to a different spell of that level without swapping&nbsp;any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell&nbsp;normally does.</p>
