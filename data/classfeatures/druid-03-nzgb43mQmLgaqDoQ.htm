<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You command the most potent forces of primal magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using primal spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you don’t gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the&nbsp;@Item[Hierophant’s Power] feat to gain a second slot.</span></p>
