------ Description (en) ------
<p>While not equal to the heights of your panache in combat,&nbsp;you have a dramatic flair about you in any situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever you succeed at a check during exploration that would have granted you panache in combat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to further checks for actions that would grant you panache in combat. This benefit ends when the exploration changes to a different scene (as determined by&nbsp;the GM) or shifts to an encounter or downtime.&nbsp;</p>
