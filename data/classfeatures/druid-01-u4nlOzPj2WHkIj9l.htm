------ Description (en) ------
<p>You revere plants and the bounty of nature, acting as both a gardener and warden for the wilderness, teaching sustainable techniques to communities, and helping areas&nbsp; regrow after disasters or negligent humanoid expansion. You are trained in Diplomacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also gain the @Item[Leshy Familiar] druid feat. You gain the @Item[Goodberry] order spell, and you increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Committing wanton cruelty to plants or killing plants unnecessarily is anathema to your order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(This doesn’t prevent you from defending yourself against plants or harvesting them when necessary for survival.)</p>
