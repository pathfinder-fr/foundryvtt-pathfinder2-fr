<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">All champions of evil alignment follow these tenets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>You must never perform acts anathema to your deity or willingly commit a purely good act, such as giving something solely out of charity, casting a good spell, or using a good item.</li>
<li>You must never put another person's needs before your own, and you must never put your own needs before those of your deity. Though you can perform acts others might consider helpful, it must be done with the expectation that it ultimately furthers your own goals or those of your master.</li>
</ul>
