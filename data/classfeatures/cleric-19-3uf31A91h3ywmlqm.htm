<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You’re exalted by your deity and gain truly incredible spells. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using divine spellcasting. You don’t gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the @Item[Maker of Miracles] feat to gain a second slot.&nbsp;</span></p>
