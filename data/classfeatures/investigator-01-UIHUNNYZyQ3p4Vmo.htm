------ Description (en) ------
<p>People can’t help but trust you, whether through your inherent likableness or your firm insistence on sticking to the truth. You have a way about you that gets others talking, and you’ve developed interrogative techniques to help you get to the truth of your investigations.</p>
<p>You are trained in Diplomacy. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.6ON8DjFXSMITZleX]{No Cause For Alarm} skill feat. You can also @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.xTK2zsWFyxSJvYbX]{Pursue a Lead} over the course of a conversation rather than spending dedicated time looking into the lead, provided the conversation lasts 1 minute or longer. For example, while trying to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OX4fy22hQgUHDr0q]{Make an Impression}, you could pursue the creature you’re conversing with as a lead, and you could Pursue a Lead about an object while someone is telling you information about that object. You also gain the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.xccOiNL2W1EtfUYl]{Pointed Question} action.</p>
