------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your patron and familiar teach you special spells called hexes. A hex is a short-term effect drawn directly from your patron’s magic. As such, you can cast only one hex each turn; attempts to cast a second hex spell on that turn fail and the spellcasting actions are lost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hexes are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with your familiar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don’t require spell slots, and you can’t cast them using spell slots. Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can&nbsp;never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear on page 300 of the Core Rulebook.</p>
<p>You learn the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.rMOI8JFJ0nT2mrCF]{Phase Familiar} hex, which you can cast as a reaction to protect your familiar from harm. You learn most other hexes from @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.SOan0fqyFTrkqJLV]{Witch Lessons}.</p>
<h3>Hex Cantrips</h3>
<p>Hex cantrips are special hexes that don’t cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like, though you can still cast only one hex each round. Hex cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose with your witch spellcasting and aren’t counted toward your prepared cantrips. Your hex cantrips are determined by your @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.nocYmxbi4rqCC2qS]{Patron Theme}.</p>
