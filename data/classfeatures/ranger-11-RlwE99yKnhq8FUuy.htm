<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You move quickly through obstacles, whether they’re tumbled stone, tangled undergrowth, or sucking mud. You can ignore the effects of non-magical difficult terrain. As normal for ignoring difficult terrain, this also lets you treat the hindrances of greater difficult terrain as those of difficult terrain.&nbsp;</span></p>
