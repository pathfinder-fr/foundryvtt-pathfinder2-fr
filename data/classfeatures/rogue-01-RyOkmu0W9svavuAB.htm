------ Description (en) ------
<p>Where others might use sleight of hand or a silver tongue&nbsp;to achieve their objectives, you rely on your intellect to&nbsp;craft intricate schemes. You likely view your operations&nbsp;as a chess game, always planning 10 steps ahead where&nbsp;others might plan three. You might be a detective&nbsp;determined to solve crimes or a spymaster in the service&nbsp;of a powerful family or nation. If you operate outside the&nbsp;law, you might be an aspiring crime lord or information&nbsp;broker, excellent at directing others toward suitable jobs.</p>
<p>If you successfully identify a creature using @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.KygTSeDvsFoSO6HW]{Recall Knowledge}, that creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} against your attacks until the start of your next turn; if you critically&nbsp;succeed, it’s flat-footed against your attacks for 1 minute.</p>
<p>You’re trained in Society and one of the following skills&nbsp;of your choice: Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion.&nbsp;You can choose Intelligence as your key ability score.</p>
