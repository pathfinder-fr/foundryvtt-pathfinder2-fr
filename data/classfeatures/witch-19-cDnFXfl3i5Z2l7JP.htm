------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your patron grants you the power to command incredible&nbsp;works of magic. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and&nbsp;can prepare a spell in that slot using witch spellcasting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike with other spell slots, these spell slots can’t be used&nbsp;for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell&nbsp;slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You don’t&nbsp;gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can&nbsp;take the Patron’s Truth feat (page 105) to gain a second slot.</p>
