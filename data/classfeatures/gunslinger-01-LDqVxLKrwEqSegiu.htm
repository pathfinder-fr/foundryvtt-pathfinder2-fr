------ Description (en) ------
<p>All gunslingers have a particular way they follow, a combination of philosophy and combat style that defines both how they fight and the weapons they excel with. At 1st level, your way grants you an initial deed, a unique reload action called a slinger's reload, and proficiency with a particular skill. You also gain advanced and greater deeds at later levels, as well as access to way-specific feats.</p>
<p><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.a3pSIKkDVTvvNSRO]{Way of the Drifter}:</strong> You wander across the battlefield, equally at home in and out of the fray.</p>
<p><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.qRLRrHf0kzaJ7xt0]{Way of the Pistolero}:</strong> You carefully maintain your distance at a duelist's 10 paces with pistol in hand.</p>
<p><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.QWXvksGJhOjXbBqi]{Way of the Sniper}:</strong> You practice a methodical style of shooting, striking from far cover.</p>
