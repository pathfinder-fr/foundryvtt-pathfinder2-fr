------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Nothing beats the thrill of taking something that belongs to someone else, especially if you can do so completely unnoticed. You might be a pickpocket working the streets, a cat burglar sneaking through windows and escaping via rooftops, or a safecracker breaking into carefully guarded vaults. You might even work as a consultant, testing clients’ defenses by trying to steal something precious.<br></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">When a fight breaks out, you prefer swift, lightweight weapons, and you strike where it hurts. When you attack with a <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=179">finesse</a> melee weapon, you can add your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls instead of your Strength modifier.<br></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You are trained in <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=17">Thievery</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
