------ Description (en) ------
<p>The savage, uncontrollable call of the natural world infuses you, granting you the ability to change your shape and take on the ferocious form of a wild creature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are trained in Intimidation. You also gain the @Item[Wild Shape] druid feat. You gain the @Item[Wild Morph] order spell. Becoming fully domesticated by the temptations of civilization is anathema to your order. (This doesn’t prevent you from buying and using processed goods or staying in a city for an adventure, but you can never come to rely on these conveniences or truly call such a place your permanent home.)</p>
