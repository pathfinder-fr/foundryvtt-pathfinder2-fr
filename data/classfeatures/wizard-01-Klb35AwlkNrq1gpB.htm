------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your thesis maintains that early and intense adoption of staves from the first days of study can create a symbiotic bond between spellcaster and @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.FVjTuBCIefAgloUU]{Staff}, allowing them to create remarkable magic together. You’ve formed such a connection with a makeshift staff you built, and you are ready to infuse any staff you encounter with greater power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You begin play with a makeshift staff of your own invention. It contains one cantrip and one 1st-level spell, both from your spellbook, but it gains no charges normally during your preparations; you must expend a spell slot to grant it charges in the same way you would add additional charges to a normal staff (Core Rulebook 592). You can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.rmwa3OyhTZ2i2AHl]{Craft} your makeshift staff into any other type of staff for the new staff’s usual cost, adding the two spells you originally chose to the staff you Craft.</p>
<p>At 8th level, you can expend two spells instead of one&nbsp;when preparing your staff, adding additional charges&nbsp;equal to the combined levels of the expended spells. At&nbsp;16th level, you can expend up to a total of three spells to&nbsp;add charges to the staff, adding additional charges equal to&nbsp;the combined levels of all three spells.</p>
