Name: Polymath
Nom: 
État: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your muse is a jack of all trades, flitting between skills and pursuits. If it’s is a creature, it might be an eclectic creature like a fey; if a deity, it might be Desna or Calistria. As a bard with a polymath muse, you are interested in a wide array of topics but rarely dedicated to any one, and you rarely make up your mind—you want to try everything. You gain the @Item[Versatile Performance] feat and add @Item[Unseen Servant] to your spell repertoire.&nbsp;</p>
