------ Description (en) ------
<p>Through dedicated study and practice, you can harness arcane power to cast spells. You can cast arcane spells using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell} activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells on page 302).</p>
<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook, plus one extra cantrip and spell of your chosen school of each level you can cast if you are a specialist wizard. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>
<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 3–19: Wizard Spells per Day on page 205.</p>
