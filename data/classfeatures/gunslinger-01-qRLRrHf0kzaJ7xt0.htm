<p>Whether you're a professional duelist or a pistol-twirling entertainer, you have quick feet and quicker hands that never seem to let you down, and an equally sharp wit and tongue that jab your foes.

Either way, you stay close enough to your enemies to leverage your superior reflexes while leaving enough space to safely fire.</p>
