<p>Your mastery of skills allows you to overwhelm your prey. If you have master proficiency in Deception, Intimidation, Stealth, or the skill you use to Recall Knowledge about your prey, increase the circumstance bonus against the prey with that skill from +2 to +4.</p>
<p>If you have master proficiency with your armor, increase the circumstance bonus to AC against the prey from +1 to +2.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Automation Notes:</em> The bonus to recall knowledge has been set up for arcana, crafting, nature, occultism, religion, and society only. The bonus to AC is based on your unarmored proficiency, and not on the proficiency of the armor you're wearing.</p>
