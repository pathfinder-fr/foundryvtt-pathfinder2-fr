You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.jks2h5pMsm8pCi8e]{Wildfire} order spell. Allowing unnatural fires to spread or preventing natural fires from occurring in a way that harms the environment are anathema to your order (this doesn't prevent you from using fire destructively or force you to combat a controlled or natural fire).</p>
