<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Focusing your will into your physical attacks imbues them with mystical energy. Your unarmed attacks become magical, allowing them to get past resistances to non-magical attacks. However, you still need an item such as <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=441"><em>handwraps of mighty blows</em></a> to gain an item bonus to attack rolls or increase your attacks’ weapon damage dice.&nbsp;</span></p>
