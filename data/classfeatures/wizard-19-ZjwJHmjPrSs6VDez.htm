------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You command the most potent arcane magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using arcane spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you don’t gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=662">Archwizard’s Might</a> feat to gain a second slot.&nbsp;</span></p>
