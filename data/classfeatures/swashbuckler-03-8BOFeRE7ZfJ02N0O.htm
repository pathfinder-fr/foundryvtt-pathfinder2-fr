------ Description (en) ------
<p>When you’ve made an impression, you move even faster than normal, darting about&nbsp;the battlefield with incredible speed. Increase the status bonus to your Speeds when&nbsp;you have panache to a +10-foot status bonus; this bonus increases by 5 feet at 7th,&nbsp;11th, 15th, and 19th levels. When you don’t have panache, you still get half this status&nbsp;bonus to your Speed, rounded down to the nearest 5-foot increment.</p>
