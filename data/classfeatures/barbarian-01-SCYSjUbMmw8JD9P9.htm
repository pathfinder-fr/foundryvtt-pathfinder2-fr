------ Description (en) ------
<p>A deep distrust of magic drives you to forgo and&nbsp;counter the metaphysical nonsense of spellcasters.&nbsp;Whether you’re a member of a superstitious family&nbsp;or culture that distrusts magic, a warrior in constant&nbsp;battle against wizards and witches, a survivor of a&nbsp;magical accident that instilled an intense aversion in&nbsp;your mind and body, or a scion of a bloodline known&nbsp;for its magic resistance, your rage is inimical to magic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This makes you an excellent mage hunter but slow&nbsp;to trust practitioners of magical arts. Your extremely&nbsp;restrictive anathema grants you powers beyond those&nbsp;of other instincts.</p>
<h2>Anathema</h2>
<p>Willingly accepting the effects of magic spells (including&nbsp;from scrolls, wands, and the like), even from your allies,&nbsp;is anathema to your instinct. You can still drink potions&nbsp;and invest and activate most magic items you find,&nbsp;though items that cast spells are subject to the same&nbsp;restrictions as all other spells. If an ally insists on using&nbsp;magic on you despite your unwillingness, and you have&nbsp;no reason to believe they will stop, continuing to travel&nbsp;with that ally of your own free will counts as willingly&nbsp;accepting their spells (as do similar circumstances) and&nbsp;thus is also anathema to your instinct.</p>
<h2>Supersticious Resiliance (Instinct Ability)</h2>
<p>While raging, you gain a +2 status bonus to all saves&nbsp;against magic. Increase your damage from Rage from&nbsp;2 to 4 against creatures that can cast spells. Once every&nbsp;10 minutes, when you Rage, you regain Hit Points&nbsp;equal to the temporary Hit Points you gain from that&nbsp;Rage action.</p>
<h2>Specialization Ability&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7th</h2>
<p>Increase the damage from Rage from 4 to 8 against&nbsp;creatures that can cast spells. If you have greater raging&nbsp;specialization, instead increase the damage from Rage&nbsp;to 12 against creatures with spells and 8 against other&nbsp;creatures.</p>
<h2>Raging Resistance&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9th</h2>
<p>Choose two associated magical traditions: arcane and&nbsp;occult, arcane and primal, divine and occult, or divine&nbsp;and primal. The resistance from your raging resistance&nbsp;class feature applies against all damage you take from&nbsp;spells cast with these two traditions of magic, regardless&nbsp;of the type of damage dealt by the spell.</p>
