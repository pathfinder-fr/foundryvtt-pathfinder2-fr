------ Description (en) ------
<p>For more than a century, the Pathfinder Society has clashed with the avaricious and underhanded Aspis Consortium, and several years ago the Society dealt its rival a decisive blow. You may be one of the few survivors of a doomed Aspis expedition, or perhaps you chafed at the Consortium&rsquo;s villainous practices and defected to the Pathfinders. No matter your reasons, you know how to be efficient and ruthless when the circumstances demand.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Intelligence</strong> or <strong>Charisma</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trained in the Intimidation skill and the Aspis Consortium Lore skill. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.gUqvezs2zzoTXFAI]{Group Coercion} skill feat. You gain access to any uncommon options as though you were a member of the Aspis Consortium.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Special</strong>: You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 7 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
