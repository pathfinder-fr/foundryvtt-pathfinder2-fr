------ Description (en) ------
<p>While you once spoke to a small congregation in a ramshackle church, those days are behind you now. Your church was destroyed, your congregants scattered, and now you meander the lands holding a worn copy of your religious text in one hand, and a fiery conviction in the other.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to <strong>Constitution</strong> or <strong>Wisdom</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You're trained in the Religion skill and a Lore skill associated with the deity you preach for (such as Pharasmin Lore). You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.BqceQIKE0lwIS98s]{Pilgrim's Token} skill feat.</p>
