<p>It&rsquo;s a well-known secret that for every playhouse in the Ivy District, there&rsquo;s an underground criminal element lurking somewhere in the shadows.

You&rsquo;re one such agent, and you&rsquo;ve put your life on the line more times than you can count by getting close to the Ivy&rsquo;s most dangerous criminals. Your risky missions and thrill-seeking derring-do have earned you many accolades&mdash;but also no shortage of enemies.</p>
