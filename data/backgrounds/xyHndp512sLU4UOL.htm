------ Description (en) ------
<p>The vast tundra and looming mountains of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords may seem featureless and barren to the untrained eye, but you know better. You see what others don't: nutritious roots buried beneath muddy reeds, succulent bird eggs cradled in craggy rocks, restorative berries nestled among thorny thickets, and more. In the south, farmers toil in dusty fields to eat the same vegetables every day, but your diet is varied and you're rarely hungry-the entire Realm is your garden.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Constitution</strong> or <strong>Wisdom</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You're trained in the Survival skill and the Herbalism Lore skill. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.8qebBeOJsyRIchcu]{Forager} skill feat.</p>
