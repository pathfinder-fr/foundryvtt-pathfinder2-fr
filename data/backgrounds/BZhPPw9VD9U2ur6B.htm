------ Description (en) ------
<p>While in a dismal forest or remote swamp, you caught sight of a string of lights bobbing through the trees. You stepped forward for a closer look, and then still further when the lights retreated a few paces. Then you remembered the rumors. Will-o'-wisps, rushlights, corpse lanterns—whatever they're called—such evil creatures lead people to their doom. With a supreme effort of will, you broke free from the alluring enchantment, and you've resolved to never let the strange lights of remote wildernesses claim you again.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Dexterity</strong> or <strong>Wisdom</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
