------ Description (en) ------
<p>You're the medic many turn to when a more official clinic or healer might not be available. You may specialize in stitching up bullet wounds or have a standing, confidential deal with a criminal syndicate to provide your services any time of day or night. In either case, you've perhaps turned to the adventuring life because a former client is unhappy with your work or members of the local constabulary have been asking too many questions.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Constitution</strong> or <strong>Wisdom</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You're trained in the Medicine skill and the Underworld Lore skill. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.bkZgWFSFV4cAf5Ot]{Risky Surgery} skill feat.</p>
