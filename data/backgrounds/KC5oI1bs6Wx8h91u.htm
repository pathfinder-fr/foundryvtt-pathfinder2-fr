<p>While your life may have taken some twists and turns in the intervening years, you were once deputized as the lawful protector of a community. While the role was temporary and you've since turned in your badge, that responsibility shaped you. Whenever a community is in trouble, and the sheriff is nowhere to be found, residents call on you to capture a criminal, rescue the mayor's offspring from bandits, or go toe to toe with outlaws.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Dexterity</strong> or <strong>Wisdom</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
