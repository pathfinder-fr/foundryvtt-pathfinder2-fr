------ Description (en) ------
<p>You were born into a lineage of undead slayers. No mere occupation, in your family slaying is a mantle of almost mystic responsibility passed from parent to child. Over the generations, this single-minded focus has begun to manifest in uncanny ways during combat.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Strength</strong> or <strong>Intelligence</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Undead Lore skill. You can cast <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.kcelf6IHl3L9VXXg]{Disrupt Undead}</em> as an innate divine cantrip. You can use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for this innate spell.</p>
