------ Description (en) ------
<p>The unfamiliar technology of Numeria&rsquo;s Silver Mount still baffles Society scholars, yet you are one of the innovators who discovered how to operate a handful of these futuristic tools&mdash;possibly after surviving more than a few explosions. The Society might have recruited you for your esoteric abilities, or you might have sought out the Society&rsquo;s protection in escaping the covetously vile Technic League. Even if your understanding of advanced technology is imperfect, your hard-learned lessons are invaluable in deciphering and repairing gear.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Constitution</strong> or<strong> Intelligence</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trained in the Crafting skill and the Engineering Lore skill. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ASy9AKEIRxPYUi5o]{Quick Repair} skill feat.</p>

<p><strong>Special</strong>: You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 6 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
