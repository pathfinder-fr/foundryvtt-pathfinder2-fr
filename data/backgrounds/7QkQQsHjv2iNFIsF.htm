------ Description (en) ------
<p>Resurrectionist. Body snatcher. No matter what you're called, you know where the bodies are buried, and how many coins they'll fetch when dug up. Adventuring comes naturally to you-in your mind dungeons are just oversized tombs-as does returning home with your loot undetected.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Strength</strong> or <strong>Dexterity</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You're trained in the Stealth skill and the Underworld Lore skill. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.t3btih0O5RUwWynt]{Experienced Smuggler} skill feat.</p>
