------ Description (en) ------
<p>Like your parents and your parents before them, you initially followed the long path toward politics from an early age. Your close association with Absalom&rsquo;s upper echelons put you in touch with the city&rsquo;s various military or special operations units&mdash;the First Guard, the Wave Riders, the Varlokkur&mdash;though you avoided any actual duty with these groups. Thanks to your strict upbringing and the connections of your family, you soon became a lauded and highly respected member of Absalom&rsquo;s political elite. But you couldn&rsquo;t stifle a certain feeling that you were destined for more than simply filling the pointed shoes of your forebears. Despite your easily earned accolades and a relatively cushy life as a young lawyer or councilmember, you sought to do more with your diplomatic training and not live out the exact same life as your ancestors.</p>
<p>Your decision to transfer to the Edgewatch has rubbed your traditionalist family the wrong way, and they&rsquo;ve cut off the financial aid they&rsquo;ve provided you your whole life. But you don&rsquo;t care&mdash;you know you&rsquo;re doing the right thing by taking on the rough jobs of a low-ranking guard, and you&rsquo;re ready to shine based on your own merits, not those of your lofty kin.</p>
