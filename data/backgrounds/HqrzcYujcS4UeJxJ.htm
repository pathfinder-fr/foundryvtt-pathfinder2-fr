<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You never expected to join a circus, but you were looking for a good place to lie low for reasons of your own. The Circus of Wayward Wonders came together with several different workers and performers a few months ago. Many came from a circus in Escadar called the Celestial Menagerie, but not all of them. It was easy to slip in among the roustabouts. Although you&rsquo;d planned to move on quickly, the circus folk have adopted you as one of their own, and they don&rsquo;t ask questions about your past.<br /></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Dexterity</strong> or <strong>Charisma</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.<br /></span></p>
