Name: Eidolon Contact (Religion)
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>You've come into contact with a disembodied being of magical essence known as an eidolon. You might have forged a powerful conduit with that eidolon, allowing you to manifest it as a summoner, but it's much more likely that you lost contact over time, though not before learning a few half-remembered secrets. If you lost contact, you might have become an adventurer to try to reach the eidolon again, or to be sure that you're rid of it forever.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Constitution</strong> or <strong>Charisma</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You're trained in the Religion skill and a Lore skill for the creature associated with your contacted eidolon (such as Angel Lore or Dragon Lore). You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.1Bt7uCW2WI4sM84P]{Dubious Knowledge} skill feat.</p>
