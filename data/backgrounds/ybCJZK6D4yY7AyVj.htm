<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-ddbf9a70-7fff-fc3b-0fb7-dadc149f3c03">You are a prominent member of a royal family. You have taken up the life of an adventurer&mdash;perhaps you&rsquo;re a deposed queen hoping to regain her throne, a prince seeking a more exciting life, or a princess on a secret mission. </span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-ddbf9a70-7fff-fc3b-0fb7-dadc149f3c03">Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Intelligence </strong>or <strong>Charisma</strong>, and one is a free ability boost. </span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-ddbf9a70-7fff-fc3b-0fb7-dadc149f3c03">You are trained in Society. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.JtjnFsOToBLnSRO9]{Courtly Graces} skill feat and can influence commoners in your family&rsquo;s territory, as well as nobility anywhere. If you later gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.iCv8KTZ5PcF4GqeV]{Connections} skill feat, you automatically have common and noble connections within any community in your royal family&rsquo;s territory and have noble connections in large communities outside your territory.</span></p>
