------ Description (en) ------
<p>The evangelist stares at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The target must immediately attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:21] save against Unnerving gaze. In addition, if the creature was already @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened}, on a failed save, the evangelist is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} from the creature for as long as the creature remains frightened.</p>
<p>After attempting this save, the creature is then temporarily immune until the start of the evangelist's next turn.</p>
