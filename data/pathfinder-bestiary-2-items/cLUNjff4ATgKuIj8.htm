------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The urdefhan damaged a creature with a jaws Strike on its last action</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The urdefhan maintains contact, turning the creature's flesh translucent around the site of the injury. The urdefhan chooses one of two options, each of which requires a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:22] save. If the jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature suffers both effects, using the same save result for both.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drain Blood</strong> The urdefhan drinks some of the creature's blood. On a failed save, the creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1} and the urdefhan regains 5 HP (or, on a critical failure, it's @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 2} and the urdefhan regains 10 HP).</li>
<li><strong>Drain Vitality</strong> The urdefhan draws out some of the creature's vital essence. The creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled 1} for 1 hour on a failed save (or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled 2} for 1 hour on a critical failure).</li>
</ul>
