------ Description (en) ------
<p>The sacristan stares at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The creature must immediately attempt a Will save against Staggering Servitude. In addition, if the creature was already @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned}, on a failed save its revulsion toward the sacristan's presence causes it to be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 2} for 1 minute. After attempting this save, the creature is then temporarily immune until the start of the sacristan's next turn.</p>
