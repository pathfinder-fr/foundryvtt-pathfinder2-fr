------ Description (en) ------
<p>A denizen of Leng maintains a connection to Leng at all times, and when away from Leng, they have @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.fJSNOw4zHGbIm4bZ]{Fast Healing 5}. They lose this ability on Leng or in areas where planar connections do not function. If killed, their body dissolves into nothingness in [[/br 1d4 #Dissolve Body]]{1d4 rounds}, leaving behind their equipment. A slain denizen reforms in Leng; they can be permanently killed only when their planar fast healing doesn't function.</p>
