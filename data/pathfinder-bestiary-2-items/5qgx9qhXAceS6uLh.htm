------ Description (en) ------
<p>There are few things as dangerously persistent in the natural world as an angry unkindness of ravens. A raven swarm can hound its prey through most barriers. Simple latches, unsecured chimney flues, loosely shuttered windows, and similar obstacles rarely keep an unkindness away. A raven swarm attempts a Thievery check to bypass many of these simple obstructions, typically against DC 20.</p>
