------ Description (en) ------
<p>Each of a two-headed troll's heads rolls their own initiative and has their own turn. Neither head can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.A72nHGUtNXgY5Ey9]{Delay}. At the start of a head's turn, that head gets 2 actions and 1 reaction. Each brain controls one of the troll's arms, but both can move the legs.</p>
<p>Any ability that would sever a two-headed troll's head (such as the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.6xaxxKfvXED6LfIY]{Vorpal} weapon property) doesn't cause the two-headed troll to die if they still have their other head, but does cause them to lose the turns, actions, and reactions of the severed head.</p>
<p>Mental effects that target a single creature affect only one of the troll's heads.</p>
