------ Description (en) ------
<p>Wounds dealt by the stygira's claws leave the flesh bleached of color and turn the blood that runs from them dark gray. Each time a creature is damaged by the stygira's claw Strike, it must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:25] save or become permanently @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} (slowed 2 on a critical failure) as its flesh stiffens like stone. If a creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points from the stygira's claw Strike and fails the saving throw against stone curse, it is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dTwPJuKgBQCMxixg]{Petrified}. A creature that spends 8 hours in direct sunlight can attempt a new saving throw to remove the effects of stone curse, even if it has been petrified.</p>
