------ Description (en) ------
<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Trigger</strong> The crystal dragon damages a creature made of flesh with a jaws Strike</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The dragon embeds transformative crystals in the creature's flesh. The creature must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:30] save.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} for 1 round as portions of its flesh turn crystalline.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the slowed condition value increases by 1 (or by 2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the slowed condition value by 1. A creature unable to act due to the slowed condition from Crystallize Flesh is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dTwPJuKgBQCMxixg]{Petrified} permanently, transforming into a crystalline statue. The effect ends if the creature is petrified or the slowed condition is removed.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target is initially @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 2}.</p>
