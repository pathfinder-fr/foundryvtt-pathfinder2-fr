------ Description (en) ------
<p>After spending 1 minute in contact with a @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}, or willing creature, a totenmaske can reshape the target's face, causing flesh to cover vital features.</p>
<p>The target can attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:25] save to resist; a critical success grants temporary immunity to Shape Flesh for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Each time the totenmaske Shapes Flesh, it chooses one feature: ears (target becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.9PR9y0bi4JPKnHPR]{Deafened}), eyes (target becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded}), mouth (target can't speak or eat), or nose (target can't smell). A creature with both its nose and mouth sealed can't breathe and begins to suffocate.</p>
<p>Changes are permanent until reversed by removing this curse, or the sealed flesh can be surgically opened with a @Check[type:medicine|dc:25] check that takes [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds} and deals [[/r {1d6}[slashing]]]{1d6 slashing damage} per round.</p>
