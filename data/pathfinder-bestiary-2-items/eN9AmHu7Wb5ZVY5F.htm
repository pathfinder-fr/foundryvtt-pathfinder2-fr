<p><strong>Trigger</strong> The jabberwock Flies or makes a wing Strike</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The jabberwock's wings whiffle, creating severe winds within a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]. These winds move outward from the jabberwock, and they persist until the start of the jabberwock's next turn. During this time, flight of any kind in the emanation requires a successful <span data-pf2-action="maneuverInFlight" data-pf2-dc="43" data-pf2-glyph="A" data-pf2-show-dc="gm">Acrobatics</span> check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Qf1ylAbdVi1rkc8M]{Maneuver in Flight}, and creatures flying toward the jabberwock are moving through greater difficult terrain. Creatures on the ground in the emanation must succeed at a @Check[type:athletics|dc:43|name:Approach Jabberwock] check to approach the jabberwock.</p>
