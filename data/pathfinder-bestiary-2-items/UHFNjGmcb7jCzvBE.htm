------ Description (en) ------
<p>When the giant tick Strikes a creature larger than itself, its barbed hypostome attaches it to that creature. This is similar to Grabbing the creature, but the giant tick moves with that creature rather than holding it in place. The giant tick is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} while attached. If the giant tick is killed or pushed away while attached to a creature on which it has used Blood Drain, that creature takes [[/r {1}[persistent,bleed]]] @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Bleed Damage}. Escaping the attachment or removing the giant tick in other ways doesn't cause bleed damage.</p>
