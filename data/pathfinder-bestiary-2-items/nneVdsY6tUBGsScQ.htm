------ Description (en) ------
<p>A jotund troll ordinarily has nine heads, and they can use regeneration to regrow a head that is severed from an effect like a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.6xaxxKfvXED6LfIY]{Vorpal} weapon. After regaining Hit Points from regeneration, the jotund troll attempts a @Check[type:flat|dc:8] check. On a success, one missing head is fully restored; on a critical success, two missing heads are fully restored. If a jotund troll loses their last remaining head, they die immediately.</p>
