------ Description (en) ------
<p>The marut is anathema to beings that unnaturally extend their existence, including undead. Its fists bypass such creatures' resistances to damage and apply the creatures' highest weakness to damage. If a marut kills a creature that rejuvenates, like a lich or ghost, it always knows that the creature isn't fully defeated.</p>
