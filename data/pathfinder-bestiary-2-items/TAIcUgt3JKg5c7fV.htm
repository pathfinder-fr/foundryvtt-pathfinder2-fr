<p>40 feet.</p>
<p>The scarecrow's eyes flicker with an unnerving glow. A creature can't reduce its @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened} condition below 1 as long as it is in the aura's emanation. When a creature enters or starts its turn in the aura, it must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:18] save. Birds and other avian creatures take a -2 circumstance penalty to this save.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected and is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 1}.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2} and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AdPVz7rbaVSRxHFg]{Fascinated} by the scarecrow until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 3}.</p>
