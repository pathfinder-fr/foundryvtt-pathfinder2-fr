------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a grindylow @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Tkd8sH4pwFIPzqTr]{Grabs} a creature larger than itself, it attaches to that creature. The @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} creature is not @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized}, but if it moves, the grindylow moves with it. If the creature is Medium or smaller, it takes a -5-foot status penalty to its Speeds while the grindylow is attached. The grindylow is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} while it is attached to a creature.</p>
