------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a sunflower leshy dies, a burst of primal energy explodes from its body, restoring [[/r {1d8}[healing]]]{1d8 Hit Points} to each plant creature in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]. This area immediately fills with sunflowers, becoming difficult terrain.</p>
