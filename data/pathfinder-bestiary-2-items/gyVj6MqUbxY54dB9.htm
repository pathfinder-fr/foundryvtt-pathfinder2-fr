<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> Beams of unholy light shoot from the nalfeshnee toward four items within 60 feet. If someone is holding or wearing a targeted item, they can keep it from being affected with a successful @Check[type:reflex|dc:34] save. For 1 minute, the affected items glow in nauseating colors. Any non-demon is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 2} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} as long as it holds, wears, or touches a glowing item.</p>
<p>Recovering from the sickness requires a successful @Check[type:will|dc:29] save instead of a Fortitude save. Ending the sickness this way ends the slowed condition and makes the creature temporarily immune to Light of Avarice for 24 hours.</p>
<p>If the creature removes or drops the item, both conditions end immediately but the creature doesn't become immune to Light of Avarice.</p>
