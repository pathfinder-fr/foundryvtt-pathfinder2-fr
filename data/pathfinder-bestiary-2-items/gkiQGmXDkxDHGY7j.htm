------ Description (en) ------
<p>A doprillu's unique wooden mask is the source of its power.</p>
<p>A doprillu deprived of its mask loses its regeneration and its immunity to Enfeebled and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed}, and it immediately becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled 1}. The Enfeebled value increases by 1 at the start of each of the doprillu's turns, to a maximum of Enfeebled 4. If the mask is put back on, the doprillu immediately regains its abilities and loses the Enfeebled condition.</p>
