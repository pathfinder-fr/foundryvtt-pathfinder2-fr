------ Description (en) ------
<p>The basidirond releases a cloud of invisible spores in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:20]. Each creature in the area must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:22] save or experience powerful hallucinations as long as it remains in the cloud, plus an additional [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds} after leaving the area. A creature must attempt a new save each round it remains within the area. The cloud persists for 5 rounds unless dispersed before then by a strong wind. Each hallucinating creature rolls [[/r 1d6]] each round to determine what it hallucinates that round.</p>
