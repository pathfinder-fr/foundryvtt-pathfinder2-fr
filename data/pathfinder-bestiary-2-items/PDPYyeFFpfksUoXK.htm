------ Description (en) ------
<p>The shadow giant becomes shrouded in shadows and becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed}. As the nature of this effect leaves the giant's location obvious, it can't use this concealment to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.XMcnh4cSI32tljXa]{Hide} or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VMozDqMMuK5kpoX4]{Sneak}. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until it is exposed to direct sunlight, whichever comes first.</p>
