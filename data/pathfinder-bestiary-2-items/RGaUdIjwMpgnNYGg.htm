------ Description (en) ------
<p>A specter that goes for more than a month without dealing negative damage to a living humanoid becomes desperate and almost feral. It changes alignment from lawful evil to chaotic evil, loses control of any corrupted thralls it might have, and becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.nlCjDvLMf2EkV2dl]{Quickened}. It can use its additional action only to make vile touch Strikes against humanoid targets. At the end of any turn in which it deals any amount of negative damage to a living humanoid, it reverts to lawful evil and is no longer quickened, but any thralls it lost control of remain free.</p>
