<p>A levitating creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. It can spend an Interact action to stabilize itself and negate this penalty for the remainder of its turn. If it's adjacent to a fixed object or stable terrain, it can move across the surface by climbing (if the surface is vertical) or crawling (if the surface is horizontal, such as a ceiling).</p>
<p>A flying creature can move normally but still increases its altitude as appropriate from the venom. A creature that can't fly falls as soon as it recovers from skrik nettle venom.</p>
