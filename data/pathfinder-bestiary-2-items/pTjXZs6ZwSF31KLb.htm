------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The vrykolakas' last action was a successful fangs Strike</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The vrykolakas sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 2}, and the vrykolakas regains 25 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points.</p>
<p>Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire, but it increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.</p>
<p>The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week.</p>
<p>A blood transfusion, which requires a successful @Check[type:medicine|dc:20] check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.</p>
