------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> A bleeding creature is within the baobhan sith's reach</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The baobhan sith tries to Drink the Blood from the bleeding creature's wounds. The baobhan sith attempts an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC. On a success, the victim becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1} and the baobhan sith regains 10 HP, gaining any Hit Points in excess of their maximum Hit Points as temporary Hit Points.</p>
<p>Drinking Blood from a victim that's already drained doesn't restore any Hit Points to the baobhan sith but increases the victim's drained value by 1. A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires 10 minutes, a successful @Check[type:medicine|dc:20] check, and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1.</p>
