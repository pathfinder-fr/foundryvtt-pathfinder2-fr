------ Description (en) ------
<p>The creeper bores dozens of tendrils into the brain of a Small, Medium, or Large humanoid creature that's @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}, willing, or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AdPVz7rbaVSRxHFg]{Fascinated} by Spray Pollen, and within reach of the creeper's tendrils.</p>
<p>The creature must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:18|traits:humanoid] save<span data-visibility="gm"> or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 1} (@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 2} on a critical failure)</span>.</p>
<p data-visibility="gm">Subsequent failed saves against Bore into Brain increase the stupefied value. If the creature reaches stupefied 5, it is turned into a yellow musk thrall. Boring into a creature's brain doesn't end fascination caused by Spray Pollen.</p>
