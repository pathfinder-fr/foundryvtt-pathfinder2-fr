------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An enemy targets the choker with an attack</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The choker tries to pull a creature it has @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.VcDeM8A5oI6VqhbM]{Restrained} into the path of the attack. The choker attempts an Athletics check, including its bonus to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.PMbdMWc2QroouFGD]{Grapple}. If it succeeds against the grabbed or restrained creature's Fortitude DC, the choker redirects the attack to that creature, and the attacker compares its attack roll result against the new target's AC. The choker must move the creature into a space adjacent to itself. The creature must also be moved within the attacker's reach against a melee attack or into a space between itself and the attacker against a ranged attack. The choker can't use this ability to make the attacker target itself, even if it's grabbing or restraining the attacker.</p>
