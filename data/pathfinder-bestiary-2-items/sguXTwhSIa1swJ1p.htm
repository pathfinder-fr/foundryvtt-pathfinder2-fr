------ Description (en) ------
<p>If the giant chameleon hits a creature with a tongue Strike, that creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} by the giant chameleon. The target isn't @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized}, but it can't move beyond the reach of the giant chameleon's tongue. A creature can sever the tongue with an attack that hits AC 15 and deals at least 4 slashing damage. Though this doesn't deal any damage to the giant chameleon, it prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week.</p>
