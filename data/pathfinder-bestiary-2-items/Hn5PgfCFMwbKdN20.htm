<p><strong>Failure</strong> The revenant becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AdPVz7rbaVSRxHFg]{Fascinated} by the source that triggered their self-loathing and does everything they can to destroy it until the end of the revenant's next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The revenant becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} as long as the source of their self-loathing is apparent, until they're attacked, or until they see their murderer.</p>
