<p><strong>Frequency</strong> three times per day</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The carbuncle concentrates on a creature it can see and tries to manipulate that creature. The target must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:18] save. The target then becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The attempt backfires and bolsters the target's mind instead, granting it a +1 status bonus to Will saving throws for 1 hour.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target briefly experiences an unusual but harmless sensation like an unexpected flavor or scent, an urge to eat something strange, or an amusing half-forgotten memory.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is compelled to spend all of its actions on its next turn performing harmless, pointless, and usually embarrassing actions.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the compulsion persists for 1 minute. The target can attempt a new save at the end of its turn each round to end the effect.</p>
