------ Description (en) ------
<p>A carnivorous blob's acid damages only flesh-not bone, stone, wood, or other materials- but is nonetheless devastating. Whenever a creature takes damage from this acid, it must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:33] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1} (drained 2 on a critical failure). On each subsequent failure, the drained condition value increases by 1 (or by 2 on a critical failure), to a maximum of drained 4.</p>
