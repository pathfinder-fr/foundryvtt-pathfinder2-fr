<p>1 to 3 actions</p>
<p>The witchwyrd fires one <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gKKqvLohtrSJj3BM]{Magic Missile}</em> per action spent (dealing [[/r {1d4+1}[force]]]{1d4+1 force damage} each). They can't spend more actions on this ability than they have free hands. If they use a hand that has Absorbed Force, that hand hurls two missiles instead of one, expending the held energy.</p>
