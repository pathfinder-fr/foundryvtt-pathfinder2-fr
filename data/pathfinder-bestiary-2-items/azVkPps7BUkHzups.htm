------ Description (en) ------
<p>The revenant wails horribly. Each creature within a @Template[type:burst|distance:60] must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:23] save. Regardless of the outcome of their saving throw, affected creatures are then immune to Baleful Shriek for 1 hour. The revenant's murderer never improves their degree of success due to this ability's incapacitation trait.</p>
<p>The revenant can't use Baleful Shriek again for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>
<hr />

<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2}.</p>
