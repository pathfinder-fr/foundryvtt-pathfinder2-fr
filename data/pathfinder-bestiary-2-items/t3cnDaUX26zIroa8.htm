------ Description (en) ------
<p>The ostiarius stares at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The creature must immediately attempt a Will save against Whispering Wounds. In addition, if the creature was already @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened} and fails its save, the creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AdPVz7rbaVSRxHFg]{Fascinated} by the ostiarius and can't use hostile actions. This fascination lasts for 1 round or until the ostiarius takes any hostile action against the creature or the creature's allies. Whether the creature succeeds at or fails the save, it is temporarily immune for 1 hour.</p>
