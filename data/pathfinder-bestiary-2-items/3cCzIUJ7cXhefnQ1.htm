------ Description (en) ------
<p>The spiral centurion spins furiously in place, its blades extended to slice through nearby creatures. It makes up to five melee blade Strikes. No single creature can be targeted by more than one blade Strike during one use of this ability. These attacks count toward the spiral centurion's multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after all the attacks are made.</p>
