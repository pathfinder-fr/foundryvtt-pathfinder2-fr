------ Description (en) ------
<p>A living humanoid slain by a cairn wight's weapon or claw Strike rises as a @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-2.sMNqIHHxcVBXG08h]{Spawned Wight} after [[/br 1d4 #Cairn Wight Spawn Transformation]]{1d4 rounds}. This spawned wight is under the command of the cairn wight that killed it. It doesn't have drain life or cairn wight spawn and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.i3OJZU2nk64Df3xm]{Clumsy 2} for as long as it is a spawned wight. If its creator dies, the spawned wight becomes a full-fledged, autonomous cairn wight; it regains its free will, gains drain life and cairn wight spawn, and is no longer clumsy.</p>
