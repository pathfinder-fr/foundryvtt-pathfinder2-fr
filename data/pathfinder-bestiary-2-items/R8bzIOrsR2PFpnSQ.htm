Parent Name: Belker
Name: Noxious Fumes
Nom: 
État: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirement</strong> The belker occupies the same space as a Medium or smaller creature</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The belker attempts to flow into the creature's lungs; the creature must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:23] save. On a failure, the creature partially inhales the belker and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} by the pain of the smoke rasping in its throat and lungs. The creature can attempt to exhale the belker by spending an action coughing and succeeding at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:23] save. Most of the belker remains outside the creature, so the belker can still act normally. If the belker moves out of the creature's space or uses Noxious Fumes again, the creature automatically exhales it.</p>
