------ Description (en) ------
<p>The devourer touches a creature within reach, dealing [[/r {8d6}[negative]]]{8d6 negative damage} (@Check[type:fortitude|dc:26|basic:true] save). If a creature is slain by this attack, its soul becomes trapped within the devourer. While its soul is trapped, a creature can't be resurrected except by powerful magic such as a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]{Wish}</em> spell. Destroying the devourer or successfully counteracting Devour Soul (see spell deflection) releases the soul. The devourer can hold only one soul at a time.</p>
<p>A soul has 5 soul charges per level of the originating creature (see the soul spells ability below). The devourer can expend these charges to cast spells. If the soul is freed and the creature returns to life, the creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1} for every 5 soul charges expended. If reduced to 0 soul charges, the soul is consumed and can be restored to life only by powerful magic such as <em>wish</em>.</p>
