------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirement</strong> A creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} by the esobok's jaws</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The esobok releases the target from the Grab but wrenches its spirit free as it does so. The creature must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:20] save. Creatures without souls (such as most constructs) and creatures whose bodies and souls are one (such as most celestials, fiends, and monitors) that roll a failure or critical failure on the save get a success instead.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 1}.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The esobok wrenches the target's soul from its body into its jaws. mindless undead creatures of level 2 or lower are destroyed, other undead creatures are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned} for 1 round, and all other creatures are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed}. At the end of each of its turns, a creature paralyzed by this effect can attempt a new save to end the effect. The paralysis ends automatically if the esobok attempts a jaws Strike or speaks.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but as long as a creature is stunned or paralyzed, it is also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 2}.</p>
