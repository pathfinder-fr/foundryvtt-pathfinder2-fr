------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a norn deals negative damage with a Strike, she regains 10 Hit Points. The target must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:39] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1} (@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 2} on a critical failure).</p>
