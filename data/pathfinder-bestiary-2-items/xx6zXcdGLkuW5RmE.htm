------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The quoppopak's ventral tube is in water</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The quoppopak uses Tentacle Stab against a creature within reach; if either of these Strikes hits, the creature must attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:30|traits:damaging-effect] save. On a failed save, the quoppopak shoots water through its tentacles into the creature, dealing [[/r {2d6+5}[bludgeoning]]]{2d6+5 bludgeoning damage} and making the creature @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} as its internal organs fill with water (double damage and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 2} on a critical failure).</p>
