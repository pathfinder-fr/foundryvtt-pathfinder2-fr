------ Description (en) ------
<p>30 feet.</p>
<p>A vaspercham's shell distorts nearby magic. Any creature in the aura who Casts a Spell must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:37] save.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The spell is unaffected and the caster is temporarily immune to the magic-warping aura for 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The spell is unaffected, but if the spell allows a saving throw, the vaspercham gains a +1 circumstance bonus to save against it.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> If the spell has a target and there are one or more viable targets within its range, the spell's target changes, determined randomly by the GM. If there is no other possible target within range or the spell has no target, the spell is disrupted.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The caster instead Casts another Spell, choosing randomly from their spell repertoire, prepared spells, or available focus spells (as appropriate) and selecting any targets at random.</p>
