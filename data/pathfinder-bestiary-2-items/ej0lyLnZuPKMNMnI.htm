------ Description (en) ------
<p>The vrolikai attacks a single target with all of its black flame knives. The demon makes a black flame knife Strike. On a successful attack, the vrolikai deals the damage from a black flame knife Strike to the target, plus an additional [[/r {2d6}[negative]]]{2d6 negative damage} for every black flame knife they wield beyond the first (typically [[/r {6d6}[negative]]]{6d6 negative damage}). Even on a failed attack, the vrolikai deals the damage from one black flame knife to the target, though they still miss completely on a critical failure. On a critical hit, the victim becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 2} as the focused attack drains pure life essence as well as damage.</p>
<p>This counts toward the vrolikai's multiple attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number of black flame knives the demon wields.</p>
