------ Description (en) ------
<p>A spiral centurion's top-like design makes it susceptible to effects that would cause it to fall prone. The DC of any attempt to knock the spiral centurion @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone} is reduced by 5. If the spiral centurion attempts a check or saving throw to resist being knocked prone, it takes a -5 status penalty. A spiral centurion that has been knocked prone can't use any actions other than to attempt to Stand, but it must succeed at a @Check[type:acrobatics|dc:30] check to do so.</p>
