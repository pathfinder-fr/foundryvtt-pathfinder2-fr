------ Description (en) ------
<p>The solar doesn't need to provide ammunition for their bow. When they draw their bow, they create a magical arrow of light that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius until the end of the solar's next turn.</p>
<p>On a critical hit with the arrow, if the target has 75 or fewer Hit Points after taking the damage, it drops to 0 Hit Points and becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{Dying 1} (or, if it was already dying, increases its dying value by 3).</p>
