<p>60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The leucrotta's last action was Sound Mimicry</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The leucrotta utters a plaintive cry to draw its prey closer. Each creature within the emanation that was deceived by Sound Mimicry must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:19] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AdPVz7rbaVSRxHFg]{Fascinated} and compelled to move toward the sound of the leucrotta's voice on their turn. Fascinated creatures are also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed}.</p>
<p>If the leucrotta attacks, the fascinated condition ends only for the creature that is attacked. If the leucrotta speaks a creature's name while using its Luring Cry, that creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to their saving throw to resist the ability.</p>
<p>On a successful save, a creature is temporarily immune to Luring Cry for 24 hours.</p>
