------ Description (en) ------
<p>The ravener treats an attack roll as a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, as long as the attack roll was a success. Additionally, whenever the ravener makes a critical hit with one of their Strikes, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1} condition. If the target already has a drained value of greater than 0, their drained value instead increases by 1, to a maximum of drained 4.</p>
<p>Whenever the ravener applies drain to a creature in this way, their soul ward gains 5 Hit Points.</p>
