------ Description (en) ------
<p>Once per day, a bralani can spend 1 minute to bless willing creatures within 100 feet who are about to participate in a contest. This blessing lasts 24 hours. If a blessed creature cheats or uses the contest to harm another, the creature grows visibly ill, becoming @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} and unable to remove this condition for the duration or until they withdraw from the competition. At the end of the contest, participants who competed fairly find it easier to negotiate and understand their opponent's perspective. For 1 hour, they gain a +2 status bonus to Diplomacy checks and @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.KygTSeDvsFoSO6HW]{Recall Knowledge} checks that directly pertain to their opponents.</p>
