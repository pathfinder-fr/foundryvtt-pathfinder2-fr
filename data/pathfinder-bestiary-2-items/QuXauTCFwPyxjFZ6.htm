<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes half damage.</p>
<p>Failure The creature takes full damage and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 2} by the agonizing pain of its burns.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature takes full damage and is cursed. The victim's flesh appears charred and burned, and the pain of being burned alive never fully vanishes. The cursed creature takes a -2 status penalty to all checks from the constant pain. Healing doesn't alter the appearance of the burns or lessen the penalty, but removing the curse does.</p>
