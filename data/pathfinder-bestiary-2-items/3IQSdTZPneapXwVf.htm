<p>The werecreature changes into their humanoid, hybrid, or animal shape. Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. A true werecreature's natural form is their hybrid shape. In humanoid shape, the werecreature uses their original humanoid size, loses their jaws and claw Strikes, and gains a melee fist Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to the slashing damage dealt by their claw. In animal shape, their Speed and size change to that of the animal, they gain any special Strike effects of the animal that they didn't already have (such as @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Tkd8sH4pwFIPzqTr]{Grab}), and they lose their weapon Strikes.</p>n<p>Human with fist +14 for [[/r {1d4+7}[bludgeoning]]]{1d4+7 bludgeoning damage}, or @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.ypLkUfuHHfNDsVUQ]{Tiger} with Speed 30 feet and Wrestle.</p>
