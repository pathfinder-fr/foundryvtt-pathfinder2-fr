------ Description (en) ------
<p>The theletos releases a @Template[type:cone|distance:60] of energy from its center. Creatures in the cone become overwhelmed with the knowledge of various fates that destiny has in store for them and lack of clear pathways to these potential futures. They must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:26] save or be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} indefinitely.</p>
<p>An affected creature can choose to roll twice when it attempts an attack, saving throw, or skill check and take the lower result. Regardless of the outcome, that creature is no longer slowed after that roll.</p>
<p>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-effects.QSy3KaLI1AYTR7rP]{Effect: Wrath of Fate}</p>
<p>The theletos can't use Wrath of Fate again for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>
