------ Description (en) ------
<p>The augnagar's writhing limbs and flesh seethe and squirm in a disorienting and unsettling manner. Creatures in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30] must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:34] save, after which they are temporarily immune to further Confusing Displays for 1 minute.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 1} for 1 round.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 1} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.yblD8fOR1J8rDwEQ]{Confused} for 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature can't attempt a flat check to recover from confusion whenever it takes damage from an attack or spell.</p>
