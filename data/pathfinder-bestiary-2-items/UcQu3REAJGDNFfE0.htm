------ Description (en) ------
<p>The viper vine releases a @Template[type:emanation|distance:60] of invisible pollen that stays in the air for 5 rounds unless dispersed by a moderate or stronger wind. Each creature that enters or starts its turn in the area must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:33] save or be captivated.</p>
<p>The viper vine can't use Captivating Pollen for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Captivating Pollen for 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1}.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AdPVz7rbaVSRxHFg]{Fascinated}, and it must spend each of its actions to move closer to the viper vine as expediently as possible while avoiding obvious dangers. If a captivated creature is adjacent to the viper vine, it stays still and doesn't act. It ceases to be fascinated if it's no longer in the pollen aura at the end of its turn.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, plus the creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 2} for 24 hours.</p>
