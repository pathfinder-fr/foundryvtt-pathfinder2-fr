------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a calathgar is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it immediately decays and dies, transforming into a 5-foot patch of mold (or a 10-foot patch of mold if it was killed by fire damage). This patch of mold persists for 1 minute, during which time it deals [[/r {3d6}[cold]]]{3d6 cold damage} to any creature that begins its turn in this area, or [[/r {1d6}[cold]]]{1d6 cold damage} to any creature that begins its turn in an adjacent square. The mold patch decays away after an hour, but it can be destroyed before then (treat each 5-foot square as an object with Hardness 0, 10 Hit Points, BT 5, immunity to cold, piercing, and slashing damage; the mold deals half its regular cold damage once it's broken).</p>
