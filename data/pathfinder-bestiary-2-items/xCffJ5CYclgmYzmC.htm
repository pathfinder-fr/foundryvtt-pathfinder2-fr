------ Description (en) ------
<p>Any creature hit by the cave fisher's sticky filament is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed}. The cave fisher can move while it has a creature grabbed with its filament, but it automatically releases the creature if the cave fisher moves beyond the filament's 60-foot length. The cave fisher can use only one filament at a time, and it can sever the filament and release any creature grabbed by it as a free action. The filament can be severed by a Strike that deals at least [[/r 10 #slashing]]{10 slashing damage} to it. This doesn't deal any damage to the cave fisher itself. The filament has AC 17, and its @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escape} DC is 19.</p>
