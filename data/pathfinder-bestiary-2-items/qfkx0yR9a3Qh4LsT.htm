------ Description (en) ------
<p>The zelekhut makes two chain Strikes, each targeting a different creature. Each Strike counts toward the zelekhut's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after it has made both attacks. If the zelekhut subsequently uses the @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.BCLvAx4Pz4MLa2pu]{Knockdown} action, it affects all creatures it hit with Double Attack.</p>
