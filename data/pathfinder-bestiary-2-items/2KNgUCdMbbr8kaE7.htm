------ Description (en) ------
<p>A creature hit by the froghemoth's tongue becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} by the froghemoth. The creature isn't @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized}, but it can't move beyond the reach of the froghemoth's tongue. A creature can sever the tongue with a successful Strike against AC 31 that deals at least 15 slashing damage.</p>
<p>This deals no damage to the froghemoth but prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes 1 minute.</p>
