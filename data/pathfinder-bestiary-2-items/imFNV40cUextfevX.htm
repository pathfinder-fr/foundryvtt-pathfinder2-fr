When a creature starts its turn in this area, it must attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:20] save. On a failure, it takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it leaves the area, and on a critical failure it is also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} for 1 round. A creature can attempt to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escape} to remove these effects.</p>
