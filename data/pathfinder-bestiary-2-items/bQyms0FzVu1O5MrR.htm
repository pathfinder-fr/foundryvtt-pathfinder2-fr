------ Description (en) ------
<p>The aurumvorax makes a jaws Strike against a creature it has grabbed. If the attack hits, the target is knocked @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone} if it is Medium or smaller. In addition, if the target is wearing armor with Hardness 10 or lower, the armor becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6dNUvdb1dhToNDj3]{Broken}. If this Strike breaks a creature's armor or damages a creature that is unarmored or wearing broken armor, the target also takes @Localize[PF2E.PersistentDamage.Bleed1d6.success]. This Strike doesn't further damage armor that's already broken.</p>
