------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a flytrap leshy dies, a burst of primal energy explodes from its body, restoring [[/r {3d6}[healing]]]{3d6 Hit Points} to each plant creature in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30].</p>
<p>This area immediately fills with flytraps, becoming difficult terrain. If the terrain is not a viable environment for these flytraps, they wither after 24 hours.</p>
