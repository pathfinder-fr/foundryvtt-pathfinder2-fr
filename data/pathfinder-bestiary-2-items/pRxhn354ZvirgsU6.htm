------ Description (en) ------
<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within 30 feet suffers the effects from stage 2 of rupturing venom</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The chernobue calls out telepathically to the semi-alive toxin, causing it to burst out of the target's body and slither through the air to drain back into one of the chernobue's mouths. The poisoned creature takes [[/r {7d6}[bludgeoning]]]{7d6 bludgeoning damage} (@Check[type:fortitude|dc:32|basic:true] save) as the venom exits its body, but is thereafter cured of rupturing venom, and the chernobue regains an equal number of Hit Points.</p>
