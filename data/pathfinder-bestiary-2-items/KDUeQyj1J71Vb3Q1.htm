<p>The dread wraith absorbs the essence of the target wraith, becoming @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.nlCjDvLMf2EkV2dl]{Quickened} and gaining a +10-foot status bonus to its fly Speed for a number of rounds equal to the level of the absorbed wraith. It can use its extra action only to Fly or Strike.</p>
