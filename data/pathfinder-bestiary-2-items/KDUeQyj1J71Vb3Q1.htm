<p>The dread wraith extends its hand toward another wraith creature within 100 feet. The target wraith dissolves and streaks toward the dread wraith in a straight line, dealing [[/r {6d10}[negative]]]{6d10 negative damage} to each creature along the line (@Check[type:fortitude|dc:28|basic:true] save).</p>
<p>The dread wraith absorbs the essence of the target wraith, becoming @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.nlCjDvLMf2EkV2dl]{Quickened} and gaining a +10-foot status bonus to its fly Speed for a number of rounds equal to the level of the absorbed wraith. It can use its extra action only to Fly or Strike.</p>
<p>An unwilling target can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:28] save to resist being absorbed.</p>
