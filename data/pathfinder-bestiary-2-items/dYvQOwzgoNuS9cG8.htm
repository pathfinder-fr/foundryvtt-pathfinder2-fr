------ Description (en) ------
<p>The intellect devourer reduces in size and burrows into the brain of a creature dead for no longer than 1 day. At the start of the intellect devourer's next turn, the body revives at its maximum Hit Points, controlled by the devourer. The intellect devourer is conscious and can sense everything the possessed body could.</p>
<p>Any effect that ends the possession kills the host body with the same effects as Exit Body. The intellect devourer can't use any of the host creature's spells with Body Thief but can use its own spells.</p>
<p>The host body slowly decays while inhabited by the intellect devourer, becoming uninhabitable after 7 days unless preserved with <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.xRgU9rrhmGAgG4Rc]{Gentle Repose}</em> or a similar effect.</p>
