<p>An attic whisperer enshrouds itself in a tapestry of stolen voices. Each living creature that enters or starts their turn in the aura must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:19] save or the unnerving, bitter sobs render them distraught and they become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 1} for as long as they remain within the aura. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune for 1 hour.</p>
<p>The attic whisperer can activate or deactivate the aura with a single free action, which has the concentrate trait.</p>
