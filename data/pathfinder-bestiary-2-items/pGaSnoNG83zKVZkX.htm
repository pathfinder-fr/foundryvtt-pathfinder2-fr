------ Description (en) ------
<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Trigger</strong> The dragon is the target of a ranged attack</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The dragon is aware of the attack and has a free wing</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The cloud dragon flexes a wing and creates a billowing cloud of mist. The dragon is treated as if they were @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} for the purposes of resolving the triggering attack, so normally the attacker must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:11] check to target them. The dragon also gains a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack.</p>
