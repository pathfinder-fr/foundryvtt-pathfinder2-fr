------ Description (en) ------
<p>A froghemoth's alien eyes allow it to perceive creatures within 30 feet, even if they are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible} or ethereal. It can still be fooled by successful Stealth checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.XMcnh4cSI32tljXa]{Hide}, but it has Perception DC 38 in such cases. It also sees through and is unaffected by illusions with the visual trait if they are within 30 feet.</p>
