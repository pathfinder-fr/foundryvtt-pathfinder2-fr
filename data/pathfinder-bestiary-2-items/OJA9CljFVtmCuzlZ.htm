------ Description (en) ------
<p>The star archon calculates a celestial constellation and sends their starknife flying along that path from one foe to the next. It makes a starknife Strike against a target within 60 feet. If the Strike hits, it can make another Strike at a different target within 60 feet of the first target, and so on, until it misses with a Strike or runs out of targets it hasn't attacked within range of the most recent target.</p>
<p>The star archon can attack a given target only once per use of this ability. These attacks don't apply any range increment penalty, and the star archon resolves all the attacks before increasing the multiple attack penalty.</p>
