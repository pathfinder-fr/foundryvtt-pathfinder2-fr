------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a hound of Tindalos is not adjacent to a structural angle of 90º (or more acute), its resistance to physical damage is suppressed and it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1}. It can't recover from this sickened condition, but the condition ends automatically once the hound is again adjacent to a suitable angle.</p>
