<p>The giant squid makes up to four arm Strikes, each with a different arm and against a different target. The giant squid then makes a beak Strike against one creature that it @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} during Ravenous Embrace. Each arm Strike counts separately for the squid's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until the squid has made all of its arm Strikes; the beak Strike uses the multiple attack penalty as normal.</p>
