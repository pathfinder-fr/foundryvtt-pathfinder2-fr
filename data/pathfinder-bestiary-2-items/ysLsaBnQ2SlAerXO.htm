<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Trigger</strong> The carbuncle takes damage</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The carbuncle feigns death by teleporting away and leaving a replica of its corpse behind, creating a colorful flash of light and a croaking sound. The real carbuncle transports to a clear space within 30 feet that it can see, and a hollow shell remains behind. The fake body appears solid until it is touched, at which point it crumbles to dust.</p>
