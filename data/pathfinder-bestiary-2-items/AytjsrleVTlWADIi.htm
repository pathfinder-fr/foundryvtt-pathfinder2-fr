<hr />
<p>A creature entering the aura must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:26] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1}. It recovers after it has been out of the aura for 1 minute. This drained condition value is cumulative with the drained value caused by drain life, but not with multiple draining presence auras.</p>
<p>A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to draining presence for 24 hours.</p>
