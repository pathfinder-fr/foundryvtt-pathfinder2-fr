------ Description (en) ------
<p>A creature hit by the giant toad's tongue becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} by the giant toad. The creature isn't @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized}, but it can't move beyond the reach of the toad's tongue. A creature can sever the tongue with a successful Strike against AC 15 that deals at least 6 slashing damage.</p>
<p>This deals no damage to the toad but prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week.</p>
