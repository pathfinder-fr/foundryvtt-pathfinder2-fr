<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The vexgit makes a +9 spell attack against a creature or unattended object. If they succeed, the vexgit deals [[/r 1d6]] damage (doubled on a critical hit) to a metal item the target is wearing or holding, ignoring its Hardness. If they hit an unattended metal item, the item takes this damage automatically.</p>
<p>If a creature uses @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.m4HQ2o5aPxjXf2kY]{Shield Block} with a metal shield against this attack, the shield is automatically @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6dNUvdb1dhToNDj3]{Broken}, but no other item is rusted on that attack.</p>
