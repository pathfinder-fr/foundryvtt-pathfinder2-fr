------ Description (en) ------
<p>If the revenant's murderer dies, the revenant is immediately destroyed. A revenant that can't sense their murderer must attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:11] check once every 24 hours to avoid becoming @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone}; they immediately rise again once they can sense their murderer. A murderer who becomes undead does not trigger the revenant's destruction until the murderer is finally destroyed. The revenant gains a +2 status bonus to checks and DCs against their murderer.</p>
