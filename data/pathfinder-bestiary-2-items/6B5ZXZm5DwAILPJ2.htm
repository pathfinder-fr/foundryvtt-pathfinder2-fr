<p>The necrophidius sways, its serpentine form undulating and clattering in a hypnotic rhythm. Each creature that witnesses the dance must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:18] save.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unnerved by the swaying and becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} until the end of the necrophidius's next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is distracted by the swaying, becoming @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 1}. After it recovers, it is flat-footed until the end of the necrophidius's next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 3}.</p>
