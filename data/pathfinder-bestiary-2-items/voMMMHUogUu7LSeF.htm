------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirement</strong> The azuretzi is not currently using Mocking Touch on a spell</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The azuretzi mocks a creature's magical ability with a touch. The azuretzi must attempt a Thievery check against the target's Will DC.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The azuretzi chooses one spell of up to 3rd level that the target creature has available to cast. The azuretzi gains that spell as a mock divine innate spell, and it can cast that spell once as an innate divine spell using its own DC and spell attack. It must do so before 24 hours pass or the mock spell is lost. The creature touched cannot cast the mock spell until the azuretzi casts it first or the 24 hour period passes, whichever comes first.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the azuretzi has 1 hour to cast the mock spell before it is lost, and the creature touched can cast the spell normally.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> As critical success, but the azuretzi must cast the mock spell before the end of its next turn or it is lost, and the creature touched can cast the spell normally.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Mocking Touch has no effect.</p>
