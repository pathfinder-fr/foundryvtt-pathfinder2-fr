------ Description (en) ------
<p>A taiga giant's prayers to their ancestors grant them spiritual protection. If a taiga giant loses this protection (such as by taking too much damage when using Guardian Spirit, or if the ancestors are counteracted by <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.9HpwDN4MYQJnW0LG]{Dispel Magic}</em>), it loses its immunity to the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.9qGBRpbX9NEwtAAr]{Controlled} condition and its status bonus to saving throws against enchantment and illusion effects. A taiga giant can once again be Protected by the Ancestors by performing a 10-minute prayer as an activity that has the concentrate trait.</p>
