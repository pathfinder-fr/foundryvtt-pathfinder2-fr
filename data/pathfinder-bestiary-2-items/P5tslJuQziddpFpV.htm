<p><strong>Requirements</strong> Grendel is grabbing a creature</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> Grendel makes a bludgeoning jaws Strike against the creature he's grabbing. On a hit, the creature also takes [[/r 2d6]] @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Damage} and becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Yl48xTdMh3aeQYL2]{Wounded 1}, or increases its wounded value by 1 if already wounded. On a critical hit, the creature instead becomes wounded 2, or increases its wounded value by 2 if already wounded. If a creature dies from Tooth Grind, Grendel regains 40 HP; this is a healing effect.</p>
