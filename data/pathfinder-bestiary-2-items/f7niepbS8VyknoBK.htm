------ Description (en) ------
<p>30 feet.</p>
<p>A swirling vortex of reflected color and light shimmers around the crystal dragon. Creatures in this aura's emanation are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled}. Each creature that ends its turn in the emanation must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:34] saving throw or be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 1} (or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 3} on a critical failure). Once a creature succeeds at this save, it is temporarily immune to the stunning effect for 1 minute.</p>
<p>The crystal dragon can turn this aura on or off using a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and it can choose not to affect allies.</p>
