------ Description (en) ------
<p>The chernobue's eye pulses and its lid peels back to reveal mind-bending awfulness. Creatures in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30] must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:32] save, after which they are temporarily immune to further Paralyzing Displays for 1 minute.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} for 1 round.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed} for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}. It can attempt a new save to end the effect at the end of each of its turns.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but paralyzed for 1 minute.</p>
