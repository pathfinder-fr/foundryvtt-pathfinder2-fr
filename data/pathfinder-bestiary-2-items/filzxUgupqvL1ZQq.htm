------ Description (en) ------
<p>The iguanodon makes a thumb spike Strike at an adjacent foe and then Strides up to 15 feet, dragging its thumb spike across the foe to gouge out a brutal wound. If this Strike hits, it deals an extra [[/r {1d8}[slashing]]]{1d8 points of slashing damage} and the following Stride does not trigger reactions from the creature struck. This thumb spike Strike counts as two attacks when calculating the iguanodon's multiple attack penalty.</p>
