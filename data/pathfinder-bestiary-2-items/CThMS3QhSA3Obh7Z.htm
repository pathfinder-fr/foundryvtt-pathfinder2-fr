------ Description (en) ------
<p>The shoal linnorm exhales scalding steam that deals [[/r {12d8}[fire]]]{12d8 fire damage} in a @Template[type:cone|distance:60] (@Check[type:reflex|dc:36|basic:true] save). The steam lingers until the end of the linnorm's next turn; anyone who enters the area or begins their turn in the area takes [[/r {6d8}[fire]]]{6d8 fire damage} (@Check[type:reflex|dc:36|traits:damaging-effect] save negates). During this time, the steam is so thick that it impedes movement as well as sight, turning the area into difficult terrain. All creatures in the steam become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed}, and all creatures outside the steam become concealed to creatures within it.</p>
<p>The shoal linnorm can't use Breath Weapon again for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>
