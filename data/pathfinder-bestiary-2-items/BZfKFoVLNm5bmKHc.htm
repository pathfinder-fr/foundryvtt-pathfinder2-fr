------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The target must be casting a shadow</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The peryton Flies, going no higher than 20 feet over the target creature. The target creature must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:21] save or the peryton's shadow changes to match that cast by the target creature. With their shadow so transformed, the peryton gains a +2 status bonus to attack and damage rolls against that creature.</p>
<p>In addition, each time the peryton successfully Strikes that creature, the creature must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:21] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 1}, or increase its frightened condition by 1 if it's already frightened. This is an emotion and fear effect. The shadow remains transformed for 1 hour or until the peryton Mimics a Shadow again, whichever comes first.</p>
