------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> three times per day</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The norn produces a golden thread linked to the fate of a creature within 100 feet of her, then snips it short with her shears. The target takes [[/r {100}[negative]]]{100 negative damage} (@Check[type:fortitude|dc:42|basic:true] save). If the target is reduced to 0 Hit Points from this damage, the thread is completely severed and the creature dies immediately. A creature slain by Snip Thread can't be restored to life except by <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.YfJTXyVGzLhM6V8U]{Miracle}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]{Wish}</em>, or similarly powerful magic; or by divine intervention. Regardless of the outcome of their saving throw, a creature targeted by Snip Thread then becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours. The norn can't use Snip Thread again for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>
