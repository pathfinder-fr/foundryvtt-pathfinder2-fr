------ Description (en) ------
<p>A raven can use simple items as tools, such as poking a stick at an opening to tease out a piece of food. They are also quite adept at stealing objects. A raven can't use Thievery to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.ijZ0DDFpMkWqaShd]{Palm an Object}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.cYdz2grcOcRt4jk6]{Disable Device}, or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.2EE4aF4SZpYf0R6H]{Pick a Lock}, but it can use Thievery to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.RDXXE7wMrSPCLv5k]{Steal} light objects that it can carry in its beak or talons or to accomplish other relatively simple tasks.</p>
