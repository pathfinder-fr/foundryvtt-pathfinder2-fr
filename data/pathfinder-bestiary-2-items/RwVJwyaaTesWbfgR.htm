------ Description (en) ------
<p>The ravener attempts to take control of a magical fire or a fire spell within 100 feet. If it succeeds at a counteract check (counteract level 10, counteract modifier +34), the original caster loses control of the spell or magical fire, control is transferred to the ravener, and this action counts as the ravener having Sustained the Spell with the action (if applicable). The ravener can choose to end the spell instead of taking control, if they choose.</p>
