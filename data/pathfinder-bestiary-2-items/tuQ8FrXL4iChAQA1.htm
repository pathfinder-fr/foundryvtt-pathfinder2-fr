------ Description (en) ------
<p>If exposed to direct sunlight, a cavern troll immediately becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} and can't use reactions or Trample. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the cavern troll ends its turn in sunlight. If the cavern troll's actions are reduced to 0 in this way, they become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dTwPJuKgBQCMxixg]{Petrified} until they spends at least 1 minute in darkness. Spells like <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.a3aQxCpoj1q1NQxC]{Sunburst}</em> that create magical sunlight cannot petrify a cavern troll, but the troll is slowed 1 for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds} after being exposed to such an effect.</p>
