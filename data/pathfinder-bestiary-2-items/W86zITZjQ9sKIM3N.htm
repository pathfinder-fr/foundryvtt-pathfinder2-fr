------ Description (en) ------
<p>The dracolisk stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. That creature must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:28] save. If it fails and has not already been slowed by Petrifying Glance or this ability, it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}. If the creature already was slowed by this ability or Petrifying Glance, a failed save causes the creature to be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dTwPJuKgBQCMxixg]{Petrified} permanently.</p>
<p>A creature petrified in this manner can be instantly restored to flesh by being coated (not just splashed) with fresh dracolisk or basilisk blood no more than 1 hour old. A single dracolisk contains enough blood to coat [[/r 1d4+2 #Medium creatures]] Medium creatures in this manner.</p>
