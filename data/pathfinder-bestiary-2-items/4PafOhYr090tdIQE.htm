------ Description (en) ------
<p>The bythos make two fist Strikes against a single target. If both Strikes hit, the target attempts a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:37] save. Creatures that don't get weaker with age or don't age are immune (GM's discretion).</p>
<p>If a creature becomes clumsy 4, drained 4, and enfeebled 4 due to Aging Strikes, it dies of old age.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.i3OJZU2nk64Df3xm]{Clumsy 1}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1}, and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled 1}, or increases each of these conditions by 1. This effect is cumulative with other aging strikes from bythoses, to a maximum of clumsy 4, drained 4, and enfeebled 4.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.i3OJZU2nk64Df3xm]{Clumsy 2}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 2}, and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled 2}, or increases these conditions by 2.</p>
