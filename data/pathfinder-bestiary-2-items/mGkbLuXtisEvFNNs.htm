------ Description (en) ------
<p>The dig-widget Leaps up 20 feet onto a creature or object and attempts a corkscrew Strike against it. If the Strike damages the target, the dig-widget attaches to the target (typically to the back of a creature). This is similar to @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Tkd8sH4pwFIPzqTr]{Grabbing} the creature, but the dig-widget moves with that creature rather than holding it in place. While attached, the dig-widget can't use its corkscrew. The dig-widget can be @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.7blmbDrQFNfdT731]{Shoved} off, or it can detach itself with an Interact action.</p>
