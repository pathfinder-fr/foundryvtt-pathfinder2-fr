------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a soul eater hits a creature with its claw Strike, the creature must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:23] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 1} (@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 2} on a critical failure).</p>
<p>Further damage dealt by the soul eater increases the stupefied value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of stupefied 4. This condition value decreases by 1 each time the creature gets a full night's rest. As long as the creature is stupefied by a soul eater, rest does not decrease any @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed} value that creature might have.</p>
