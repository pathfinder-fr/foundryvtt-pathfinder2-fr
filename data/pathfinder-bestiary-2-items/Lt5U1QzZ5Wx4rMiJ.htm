------ Description (en) ------
<p>A conjured soul eater forms a mental link with its conjurer. While both are on the same plane, the soul eater knows the location of its conjurer per its find target ability. If the soul eater's target dies before the soul eater can drain its soul, or if the soul eater is defeated (but not destroyed) by the target, the soul eater returns to its conjurer and tries to kill them.</p>
