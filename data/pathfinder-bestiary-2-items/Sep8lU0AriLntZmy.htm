------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> three times per day</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The vanth bestows a curse on a creature by touching it with its scythe. The creature must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:25] save.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Vanth's Curse for 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target feels a momentary shudder of doom and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 1} for 1 minute by the distracting sensation.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target becomes morose and glum as it accepts its own inevitable fate. For 1 hour, the target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 2}. Each time the target gains the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{Dying} condition, the stupefied condition value increases by 1, to a maximum value of stupefied 4.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the effect is permanent.</p>
