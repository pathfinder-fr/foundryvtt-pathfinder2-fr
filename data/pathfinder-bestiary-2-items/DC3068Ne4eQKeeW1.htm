------ Description (en) ------
<p>If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, a vrykolakas ancient can turn this creature into a vrykolakas spawn by donating some of its own blood to the creature and burying it in earth for 3 nights.</p>
<p>Such vrykolakas spawn are generally friendly to the vrykolakas that created them, but they are not under its control and typically wander off on their own rampage within [[/r 1d6 #days]]{1d6 days} of their creation.</p>
