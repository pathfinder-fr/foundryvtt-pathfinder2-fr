<p>The leucrotta perfectly imitates voices and speech and attempts a Deception check against listeners' Will DC to fool them.

The leucrotta can't duplicate voice-based abilities or spells, though it can perfectly mimic the sound of verbal spellcasting and can attempt to deceive constructs or undead that respond to voice commands. The leucrotta can't imitate speech in languages it doesn't know.</p>
