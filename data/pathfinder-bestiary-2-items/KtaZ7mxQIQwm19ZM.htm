------ Description (en) ------
<p>A creature hit by the bebilith's web Strike is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.VcDeM8A5oI6VqhbM]{Restrained} and tethered to the bebilith, preventing it from moving further away from the bebilith. The restrained creature is also under the effects of a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.ksLCg62cLOojw3gN]{Dimensional Anchor}</em> spell (DC 29) with a duration that lasts as long as the creature remains tethered. The bebilith can have only one creature tethered at a time.</p>
<p>The DC to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escape} or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.SjmKHgI7a5Z9JzBx]{Force Open} the tether is 29. The tether can be severed with a Strike (AC 20, Hardness 2, HP 20); this ends the dimensional anchor effect but does not free the restrained creature.</p>
