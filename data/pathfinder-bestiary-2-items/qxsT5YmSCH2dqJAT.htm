------ Description (en) ------
<p>A flytrap leshy can combine itself with an adjacent and willing flytrap leshy that is not currently affected by Amalgam. The leshy using Amalgam physically merges with the target, restoring [[/r {3d8}[healing]]]{3d8 Hit Points} to the target.</p>
<p>The leshy can Sustain a Spell to continue Amalgam, but once they stop, the target leshy takes [[/r {3d8}]]{3d8 damage}. If the target leshy dies, Amalgam ends at once and the original leshy gains the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{Dying} condition or increases their dying condition value by 1 if they were already dying.</p>
<p>As long as Amalgam is sustained, the target leshy gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, its AC increases to 21, and it gains an additional reaction at the start of each turn.</p>
