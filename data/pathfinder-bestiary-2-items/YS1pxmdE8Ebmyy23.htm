------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a soul eater is conjured to the Material Plane to find a specific creature, it gains the benefits of a 5th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.LQzlKbYjZSMFQawP]{Locate}</em> spell that isn't blocked by lead or running water. The conjurer must have seen the target and must speak the target's name while conjuring the soul eater in order to grant this ability.</p>
