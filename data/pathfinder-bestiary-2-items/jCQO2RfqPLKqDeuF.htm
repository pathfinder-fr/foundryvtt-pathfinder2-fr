<p>The quickling takes a -2 status penalty to saving throws against effects that cause the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed} condition. If the quickling ever becomes slowed, they lose their supernatural speed, can't Fade from View, and become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} for the duration of the slow. They also can't reduce this sickened condition for the duration of the slowed effect.</p>
