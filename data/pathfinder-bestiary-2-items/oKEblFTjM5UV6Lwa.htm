------ Description (en) ------
<p>The purrodaemon sheathes a weapon in their own flesh. This deals no damage to the purrodaemon, which can have up to 10 weapons sheathed in their body at a time. A steeped weapon must be one that deals piercing or slashing damage.</p>
<p>If a purrodaemon @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F]{Interacts} to crush a soul gem, one weapon of their choice sheathed in their flesh becomes enchanted with the daemon's fiendish power and becomes a +2 greater striking weapon that can be used in place of their glaive or hurled at targets (with a +2 item bonus to the hurled weapon's attack modifier and an extra d10 of damage). This magical quality fades 24 hours after it ceases being sheathed in the daemon's living body. A steeped weapon can be @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Dt6B1slsBy8ipJu9]{Disarmed}.</p>
