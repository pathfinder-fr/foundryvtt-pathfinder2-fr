------ Description (en) ------
<p>The specter makes a Vile Touch Strike. If it damages a living creature, the specter gains [[/r 5 #Temporary Hit Points]]{5 temporary Hit Points} and the target creature must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:24] save to avoid becoming corrupted.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to spectral corruption for 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 2} for 1 hour.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature succumbs to the corruption and becomes a spectral thrall temporarily. The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.9qGBRpbX9NEwtAAr]{Controlled} by the specter, obeying the specter's telepathic or spoken orders, though a spectral thrall does not obey obviously self-destructive orders. This lasts until the end of the thrall's next turn, at which point it is no longer controlled but becomes stupefied 2 for 1 hour.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the duration is unlimited. The thrall can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns; on a success, it is no longer controlled by the specter but becomes stupefied 2 for 1 hour.</p>
