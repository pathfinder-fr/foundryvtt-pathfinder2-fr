------ Description (en) ------
<p>When the akizendri casts <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.VVAZPCvd4d90qVA1]{Secret Page}</em>, it can physically immerse itself in the text, changing the message of the text in the process. It can exit the book at any point by Dismissing <em>secret page</em>, at which point it appears in a space adjacent to the text. If it does so to begin combat, it rolls a Deception check for initiative. As long as it remains immersed in the text, the akizendri has no body. It can communicate telepathically with a creature as long as the creature touches the book or scroll that contains the secret page. It can sense nearby creatures using its entropy sense, but not in any other way, nor can it use any attack, manipulate, or move actions or speak aloud. If the object it is immersed in is destroyed, the akizendri reappears in an adjacent square and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 1}.</p>
