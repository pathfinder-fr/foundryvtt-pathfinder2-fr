<p>When a theletos conveys information, it does so wordlessly through psychic projections. This acts as @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.kdhbPaBMK1d1fpbA]{Telepathy} with a range of 100 feet but is understandable to all creatures regardless of whether they have a language. The meaning to non-aeons can be vague and is often mysterious. A theletos can use this ability to communicate flawlessly with any other aeon on the same plane.</p>
