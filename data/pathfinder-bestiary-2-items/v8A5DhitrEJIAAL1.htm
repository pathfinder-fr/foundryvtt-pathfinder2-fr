<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Trigger</strong> A living creature within 30 feet of the ravener dies</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The ravener tears the creature's soul from its body with their maw and gulps it down. The dying creature must attempt a Fortitude save with the same DC as the ravener's Breath Weapon.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The ravener tears off a small chunk of the creature's soul. If the victim is restored to life, they are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1} in addition to any other side effects of returning to life. The ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to half the creature's level.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but the creature's soul is ravaged. The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 3} and the ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to the creature's level.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the ravener devours the entire soul. The victim can't be restored to life as long as the ravener exists except via a 10th-level effect such as miracle or wish, and the ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to twice the creature's level.</p>
