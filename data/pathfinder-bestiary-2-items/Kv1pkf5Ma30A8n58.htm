<p>The cythnigot presents its awful appearance fully, and creatures in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10] must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:17] save. Once a creature attempts this save, it's temporarily immune to further Sickening Displays for 1 minute.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} until its next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1}, and is flat-footed for as long as it's sickened.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 2} and is flat-footed for as long as it's sickened.</p>
