------ Description (en) ------
<p>The umonlee breathes a cone of extremely cold air that damages its prey and can freeze them to the ground. Its breath deals [[/r {12d8}[cold]]]{12d8 cold damage} to creatures in the @Template[type:cone|distance:50] (@Check[type:reflex|dc:38|traits:damaging-effect] save).</p>
<p>The umonlee can't use Freezing Breath again for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>

<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes half damage and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} for 1 round.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes full damage and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} for 1 round. If the creature is standing on the ground, it's @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} as thick ice forms around it, and it can't recover from being slowed. The creature remains immobilized and slowed 1 until it manages to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escape} (DC 36) or deal 30 damage to the ice, which has weakness 10 to fire.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except the creature takes double damage and the ice holding it in place requires 60 damage to break.</p>
