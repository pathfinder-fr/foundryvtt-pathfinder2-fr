------ Description (en) ------
<p>The yeth hound emits an unearthly howl audible up to 300 feet away. Any non-fiend creature that hears the howl must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:20] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 1}. Any creature that critically fails and is within 60 feet of the yeth hound is instead @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 3} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds} (or until it recovers from its frightened condition).</p>
<p>Whether it succeeds or fails the saving throw, the creature is then temporarily immune to Bay for 24 hours.</p>
