------ Description (en) ------
<p>Babaus revel in gore, and when wounds are healed, they recoil in pain. When a creature heals from damage that the babau dealt on their last turn with Grievous Strike, sneak attack, or a critical hit, the demon takes [[/r {4d6}[mental]]]{4d6 mental damage}. The babau can take this mental damage only once per round.</p>
