------ Description (en) ------
<p>A hound archon can take the appearance of any canid animal of Small to Large size. This doesn't change their Speed or the attack and damage bonuses for their Strikes, but if the canid's bite attack has the Knockdown ability, then the hound archon's bite attack gains that ability while they are in that form.</p>
