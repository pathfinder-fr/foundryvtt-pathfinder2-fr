------ Description (en) ------
<p>The interlocutor stares at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The creature must immediately attempt a Will save against glimpse of stolen flesh. In addition, if the creature was already @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned}, on a failed save, it feels its internal organs twist and writhe, and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.i3OJZU2nk64Df3xm]{Clumsy 2} for 1 minute.</p>
<p>After attempting this save, the creature is then temporarily immune until the start of the interlocutor's next turn.</p>
