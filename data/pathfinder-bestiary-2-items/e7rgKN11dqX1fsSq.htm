------ Description (en) ------
<p>The thanadaemon glares at a single creature they can see within 30 feet. If the target wasn't already @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened}, they must immediately attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:33] save against the thanadaemon's terrifying gaze. If the target was already frightened, they must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:33] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}; this second effect has the incapacitation trait. After attempting its save, the creature is temporarily immune to this ability until the start of the thanadaemon's next turn.</p>
