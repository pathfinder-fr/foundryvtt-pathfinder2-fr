------ Description (en) ------
<p>The vrolikai focuses their death-stealing gaze upon a single target they can see within 30 feet. The target must immediately attempt a Fortitude save against death-stealing gaze.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is affected by death-stealing gaze and becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1}. If the creature was already drained 1 by the death-stealing gaze before attempting the save, a failed save increases the value of the drained condition by 1, to a maximum of drained 4. The vrolikai gains 10 temporary Hit Points, and the drained creature is temporarily immune until the start of the vrolikai's next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature increases the amount of drain by 2.</p>
