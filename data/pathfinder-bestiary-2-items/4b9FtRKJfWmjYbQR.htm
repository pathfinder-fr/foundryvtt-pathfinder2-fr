<p>The eremite stares at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The creature must immediately attempt a Will save against paralytic perfection.</p>
<p>In addition, if the creature was already paralyzed, on a failed save, its unnatural longing causes it to become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed 1}.</p>
