<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> @Check[type:fortitude|dc:34]</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1} (1 day)</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 2} and the creature displays hideous, festering wounds exuding a horrific stench. Any creature within 30 feet of the victim must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:34] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} (plus @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} on a critical failure, for as long as it's sickened).</p>
<p>While within the aura, affected creatures take a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute. The victim of the disease doesn't roll a save, but takes the failure effects automatically and can't reduce its sickened value below 1 (1 day).</p>
