------ Description (en) ------
<p>A water orm can go for 10 years without feeding. Beyond this limit, the water orm's hunger causes it to become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}, but doesn't otherwise impact its lifespan. A water orm that's slowed as a result of starvation can remove this condition by using Swallow Whole to gulp down a meal.</p>
