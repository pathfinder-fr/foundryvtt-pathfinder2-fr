<p><strong>Effect</strong> The bone prophet animates corpses of snakes, serpentfolk, or similar serpentine creatures within a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]. Any flesh on the bodies sloughs off, and they rise as skeletons. The bone prophet can raise one Large creature as a skeletal giant or up to three Medium creatures as skeletal champions; the equipment and attacks might be different depending on the corpses' possessions.</p>
<p>These skeletons have the minion trait and are under the bone prophet's control; the bone prophet can give all these minions the same command with a single action that has the concentrate trait. Any skeletal minions that still remain after 10 minutes crumble to dust.</p>
