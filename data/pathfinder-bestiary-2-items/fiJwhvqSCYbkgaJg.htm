------ Description (en) ------
<p>The culdewen unleashes a string of invectives. Each creature that hears them must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:25] save, with the effects of <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.z2mfh3oPnfYqXflY]{Mariner's Curse}</em> and is then temporarily immune for 24 hours. Even on a failed save, the curse ends automatically after 1 day.</p>
