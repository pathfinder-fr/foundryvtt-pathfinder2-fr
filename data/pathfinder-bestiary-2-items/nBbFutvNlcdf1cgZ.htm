------ Description (en) ------
<p>The sarglagon conjures murky water to fill the lungs of a creature that can't breathe water within 30 feet. The target must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:26] save.</p>
<div data-visibility="gm"><hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target coughs up water and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1}.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is holding its breath. The only action it can take is to attempt a Fortitude save against Drown to expel the water, which is a single action.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target falls @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} and begins suffocating. If the target succeeds at its Fortitude save while suffocating, it coughs up the water and can breathe again.</p>
