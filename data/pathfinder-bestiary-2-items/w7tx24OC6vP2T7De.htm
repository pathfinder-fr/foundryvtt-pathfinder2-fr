------ Description (en) ------
<p>The yellow musk creeper blasts yellow pollen in either a @Template[type:line|distance:30] or a @Template[type:cone|distance:15]. Each creature in the emanation must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:20] save.</p>
<div data-visibility="gm">
<p>Once a creature succeeds at any save against Spray Pollen, it becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AdPVz7rbaVSRxHFg]{Fascinated}. For as long as it is fascinated, it must spend each of its actions to move closer to the yellow musk creeper as expediently as possible, while avoiding obvious dangers. If the creature is adjacent to the yellow musk creeper, it stays still and doesn't act. If anyone takes a hostile action against the creature or its allies, the effect ends. Otherwise, the creature can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the effects end.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the condition doesn't end automatically if anyone takes a hostile action against the creature or its allies.</p>
