------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> A creature is hooked by the culdewen's fish hook and adjacent to the culdewen</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The culdewen hoists the creature over their shoulder, as though it weighs no more than a fish. Unless the creature is unable to act, the culdewen must attempt an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.VcDeM8A5oI6VqhbM]{Restrained} by the culdewen. @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escaping} from the restrained condition (DC 25) also allows a creature to remove the hook.</p>
<p>While hoisting a creature, the culdewen gains a +20-foot status bonus to their Speeds and is compelled to escape with it (see culdewen's curse above).</p>
