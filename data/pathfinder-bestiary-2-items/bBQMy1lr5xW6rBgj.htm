------ Description (en) ------
<p>The bythos touches a creature or object to displace it from time. The target attempts a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:37|traits:damaging-effect] save.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> Time flows around the target; the target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} for 1 round.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target disappears from the present moment and reappears in the same location [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds} later as if no time had passed for it. If a creature or object occupies that space when the target returns, the target appears in the closest available space to its original location.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} for an extra [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds} after it returns.</p>
