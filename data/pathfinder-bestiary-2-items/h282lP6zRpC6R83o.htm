------ Description (en) ------
<p>The derghodaemon spews a large swarm, making a swarm spit Strike against up to two adjacent targets within range. Whether or not the targets are hit, each must attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:31|traits:damaging-effect] save (at a -2 circumstance penalty if it was actually hit by the swarm spit).</p>
<p>@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Piercing Damage} caused by the swarming infestation ends as soon as the creature takes any amount of damage from an area effect.</p>
<p>The derghodaemon can't use this ability for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The swarm disperses as soon as it deals its swarm spit Strike damage.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The swarm clings to the target and infests it, dealing [[/r {1d6}[persistent,piercing]]] @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Piercing Damage}.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The swarm clings to the target and infests it, dealing [[/r {2d6}[persistent,piercing]]] @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Piercing Damage}.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the hissing sounds caused by the infestation also cause the target to become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.yblD8fOR1J8rDwEQ]{Confused} for 1 round; this additional effect has the auditory, emotion, and mental traits.</p>
