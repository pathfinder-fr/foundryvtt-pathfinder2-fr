------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Your inner beauty and love surround you in an aura.</p>
<p>As long as you bear them no ill will, all creatures other than fiends, undead, and mindless creatures start with an attitude of friendly toward you, unless they would have been helpful instead. This doesn't mean they are willing to change their life or plans for you, and this boon does not prevent their attitudes from worsening if you try to thwart them. This effect doesn't work against deities and similarly powerful creatures.</p>
<p>Additionally, the love you share with your friends inspires them. You and your allies gain a +3 status bonus to saving throws and skill checks as long as you can see each other.</p>
