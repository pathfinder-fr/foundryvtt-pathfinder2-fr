------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: You always present yourself at your best. Your clothing and person are always clean and unrumpled, the metal of your blade and armor shining and unblemished.</p>
<p>This doesn't prevent you from being exposed to diseases and other afflictions via filth, but it protects you as well as if you had washed thoroughly right away.</p>
