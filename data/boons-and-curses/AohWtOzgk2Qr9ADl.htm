<p><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: The current of the waves constantly fights against you, putting you at risk of drowning any time you must Swim.</p>
<p>You lose any @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.c8TGiZ48ygoSPofx]{Swim} Speed you have, unless it’s your only Speed, in which case you take a –20-foot status penalty to your swim Speed.</p>
<p>When you roll an Athletics check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.c8TGiZ48ygoSPofx]{Swim}, you always use the outcome for one degree of success worse than the result of your roll.</p>
