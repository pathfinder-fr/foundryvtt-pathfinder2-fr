<p><strong>Major Curse</strong>: You have wronged those unable to obtain revenge for themselves, and Calistria's curse grants their revenge its own life.</p>
<p>Whenever another creature imagines vengeance upon you but can't pursue that vengeance because you are too powerful, well connected, or otherwise untouchable, a creature of roughly your level manifests out of their imagination and performs their desired revenge.</p>
<p>Once the revenge is complete or the manifestation is destroyed, the summoned creature vanishes from existence.</p>
