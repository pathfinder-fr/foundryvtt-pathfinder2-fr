------ Description (en) ------
<p>Irori challenges you to seek another path, rather than treat every problem as a nail just because you have a hammer. If you select a check for which you have a higher bonus when another method would have been more appropriate for the situation, such as using Deception to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.ewwCglB7XOPLUz72]{Lie} through life because it’s your highest modifier, even if it would be better to reach a compromise through Diplomacy, you must roll twice and take the lower result.</p>
