------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Any time you steal, illegally harm or kill another creature, or undermine a law-abiding officer or court, a symbol or word describing your crime appears on a visible spot on your skin. This symbol cannot be removed or hidden with makeup (though it can be covered with clothing) and it doesn&rsquo;t vanish until you make legal restitution for the crime, such as by serving your sentence.</p>
