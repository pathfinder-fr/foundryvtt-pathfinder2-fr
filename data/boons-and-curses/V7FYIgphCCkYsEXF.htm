<p><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: The sun shines its light on everything you say.</p>
<p>You become unable to tell @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.ewwCglB7XOPLUz72]{Lies}, and if you attempt to do so, you instead compulsively blurt out the truth on the matter in question. You are still able to withhold information or lie by omission.</p>
