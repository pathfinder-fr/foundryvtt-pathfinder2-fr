------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: People react as though you're insulting them, even in normal conversation. Whenever you attempt to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OX4fy22hQgUHDr0q]{Make an Impression}, the outcome is one degree of success worse than the result of your roll. If you converse with someone over a long enough period of time but don't attempt to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OX4fy22hQgUHDr0q]{Make an Impression}, you still insult them, and you suffer the effect of a critical failure to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OX4fy22hQgUHDr0q]{Make an Impression}.</p>
