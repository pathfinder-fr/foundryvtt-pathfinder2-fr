------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Major Boon (Daily)</strong>: Your silver tongue is infallible, allowing you to reach a compromise if one is even remotely possible. Once per day, you know just what to offer to make a deal or broker a negotiation, and if you offer your divinely inspired deal, you can automatically receive a result of 20 + your Diplomacy modifier on your Diplomacy check instead of rolling. This does not increase your degree of success like rolling a 20 would.</p>
<p>If there is legitimately nothing you could offer to reach an agreement, you learn that, and you don't expend your daily use of the boon.</p>
