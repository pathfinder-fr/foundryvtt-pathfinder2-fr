------ Description (en) ------
<p>Irori grants you great insight and knowledge. Once, when you roll a failure at a check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.1OagaWtBpVXExToo]{Recall Knowledge}, you get a critical success instead. Furthermore, the check loses the secret trait, so you know for sure that the result was a critical success. Irori typically grants this boon for an extremely consequential check to Recall Knowledge.</p>
