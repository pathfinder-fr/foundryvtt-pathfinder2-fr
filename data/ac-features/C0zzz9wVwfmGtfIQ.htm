------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your demon utters indescribable words writhing with its associated sin. It can cast an evil <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.sX2o0HH4RjJDAZ8C]{Divine Decree}</em> once per day as a 9th-level spell. You are unaffected by this decree, even if you aren't evil. At 19th level, this becomes a 10th-level divine decree instead.</p>
