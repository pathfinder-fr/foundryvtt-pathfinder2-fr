------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your construct eidolon has a link directly to your life force, which renders it a living creature and therefore susceptible to many ailments that bother only the living, though it does possess some resistances to these effects. It doesn't have a construct's normal immunities, but does gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against death effects, disease, necromancy, and poison effects, as well as effects causing the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Fatigued]{Fatigued} or sickened conditions. Additionally, its astral essence bleeds off slowly, and it only needs to succeed at a <span data-pf2-check="flat" data-pf2-dc="10" data-pf2-show-dc="owner">Flat Check</span> to remove persistent bleed damage (or a <span data-pf2-check="flat" data-pf2-dc="5" data-pf2-show-dc="owner">Flat Check</span> after receiving particularly effective aid).</p>
