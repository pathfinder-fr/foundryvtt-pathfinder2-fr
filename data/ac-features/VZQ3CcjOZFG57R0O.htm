------ Description (en) ------
<p>Ever full of tricks, your fey eidolon twists magical protections into your shared life force, granting it a contingency in its back pocket for desperate situations. During your daily preparations, your eidolon can cast a @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.WG91Z5TiR6oO5FOw]{Contingency} spell. The 4th-level spell it chooses must come from the primal or fey gift list, and must either be common or be another spell you have access to.</p>
