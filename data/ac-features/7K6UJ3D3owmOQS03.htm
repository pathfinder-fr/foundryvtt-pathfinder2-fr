------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your eidolon's fury boils over into a reckless, out- of-control frenzy. While frenzied, your eidolon is affected by <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.HStu2Yhw3iQER9tY]{Boost Eidolon}</em> and gains temporary Hit Points equal to your level, but it takes a -2 penalty to AC. Your eidolon can't voluntarily end the frenzy or start another frenzy while in the frenzy. The frenzy lasts for 1 minute, after which it's @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Fatigued]{Fatigued} for 1 minute and can't start another frenzy for 1 minute.</p>
