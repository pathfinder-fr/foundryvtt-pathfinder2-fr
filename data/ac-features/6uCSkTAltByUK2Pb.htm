------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your eidolon emanates a powerful aura-resembling that of an astral deva-that protects creatures as they travel. The aura has the abjuration, aura, and divine traits. Your eidolon and its allies within a @Template[type:emanation|distance:20] are protected from severe heat and cold, and your eidolon is never @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} to creatures inside the aura that are of a lower level than the eidolon.</p>
<p>When you gain the transcendence class feature, this evolves to the full benefits of an astral deva; your eidolon and allies in the aura are protected from environmental damage from any plane, including severe and extreme heat and cold as well as more unusual dangers.</p>
