<p>Your eidolon is a manifestation of the life force of nature in the form of a powerful magical beast that often has animal features, possibly even several from different species. You might have learned the way to connect with the world's life force via a specific philosophy or practice, such as the beliefs of the god callers of Sarkoris, or formed a bond on your own.
