Name: Demon Eidolon
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your eidolon is a demon, born of mortal sin congealed amid the chaos and evil of the Abyss, using its link to you to spread chaos at your side. Choose an associated sin for your demon. Demon eidolons have appearances as varied as the infinite Abyss. While demons are inherently untrustworthy, your demon eidolon has reached an accord with you and generally keeps it, though that doesn't mean your eidolon isn't actively working to bring your life deeper into its associated sin. Though a true demon, your demon eidolon's link to you as a mortal prevents them from casting the abyssal pact ritual, even if they somehow learn it.</p>
