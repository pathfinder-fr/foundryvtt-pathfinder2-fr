------ Description (en) ------
<p>Granted by @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.YZ138OqflDhrkqmR]{Enforce Oath}.</p>
<p>You gain a +1 status bonus to AC and saves against attacks and effects by the chosen creature. You also gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls against the chosen creature.</p>
<p>However, your dedication to Enforcing your Oath draws your focus away from all other foes. While you are Enforcing your Oath, you take a -1 status penalty to AC, attack rolls, and saves against all other creatures until you stop Enforcing your Oath.</p>
<p>You stop Enforcing your Oath once the chosen creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points or offers a legitimate surrender to you or your allies. You immediately stop Enforcing your Oath if you are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} or if the chosen creature goes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.9evPzg9E6muFcoSk]{Unnoticed} by you for more than 1 minute. You can also stop Enforcing your Oath at any time during your turn as a free action.</p>
