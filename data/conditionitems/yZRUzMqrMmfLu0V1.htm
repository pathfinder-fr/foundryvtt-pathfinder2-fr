------ Description (en) ------
<p>You are bleeding out or otherwise at death&rsquo;s door. While you have this condition, you are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Unconscious]. Dying always includes a value, and if it ever reaches dying 4, you die. If you&rsquo;re dying, you must attempt a recovery check (page 459) at the start of your turn each round to determine whether you get better or worse. Your dying condition increases by 1 if you take damage while dying, or by 2 if you take damage from an enemy&rsquo;s critical hit or a critical failure on your save.<br /><br />If you lose the dying condition by succeeding at a recovery check and are still at 0 Hit Points, you remain&nbsp;@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Unconscious], but you can wake up as described in that condition. You lose the dying condition automatically and wake up if you ever have 1 Hit Point or more. Any time you lose the dying condition, you gain the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Wounded] 1 condition, or increase your&nbsp;@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Wounded] condition value by 1 if you already have that condition.</p>
