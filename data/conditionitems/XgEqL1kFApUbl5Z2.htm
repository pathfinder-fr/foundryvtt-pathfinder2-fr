------ Description (en) ------
<p>You can&rsquo;t see. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to you. You can&rsquo;t detect anything using vision. You automatically critically fail Perception checks that require you to be able to see, and if vision is your only precise sense, you take a &ndash;4 status penalty to Perception checks. You are immune to visual effects. Blinded overrides @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Dazzled].</p>
