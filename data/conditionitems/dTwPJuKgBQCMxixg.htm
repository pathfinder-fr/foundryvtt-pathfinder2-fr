------ Description (en) ------
<p>You have been turned to stone. You can&rsquo;t act, nor can you sense anything. You become an object with a Bulk double your normal Bulk (typically 12 for a petrified Medium creature or 6 for a petrified Small creature), AC 9, Hardness 8, and the same current Hit Points you had when alive. You don&rsquo;t have a Broken Threshold. When you&rsquo;re turned back into flesh, you have the same number of Hit Points you had as a statue. If the statue is destroyed, you immediately die. While petrified, your mind and body are in stasis, so you don&rsquo;t age or notice the passing of time.</p>
