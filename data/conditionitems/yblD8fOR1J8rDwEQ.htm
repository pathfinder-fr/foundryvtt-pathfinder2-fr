------ Description (en) ------
<p>You don’t have your wits about you, and you attack wildly. You are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed], you don’t treat anyone as your ally (though they might still treat you as theirs), and you can’t Delay, Ready, or use reactions.<br><br>You use all your actions to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strike} or cast offensive cantrips, though the GM can have you use other actions to facilitate attack, such as draw a weapon, move so that a target is in reach, and so forth. Your targets are determined randomly by the GM. If you have no other viable targets, you target yourself, automatically hitting but not scoring a critical hit. If it’s impossible for you to attack or cast spells, you babble incoherently, wasting your actions.<br><br>Each time you take damage from an attack or spell, you can attempt a <strong>DC 11</strong> flat check to recover from your confusion and end the condition.</p>
