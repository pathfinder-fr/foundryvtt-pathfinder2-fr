------ Description (en) ------
<p>Anything in plain view is observed by you. If a creature takes measures to avoid detection, such as by using Stealth to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.XMcnh4cSI32tljXa]{Hide}, it can become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden] or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Undetected] instead of observed. If you have another precise sense instead of or in addition to sight, you might be able to observe a creature or object using that sense instead. You can observe a creature only with precise senses. When @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seeking} a creature using only imprecise senses, it remains @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden], rather than observed.</p>
