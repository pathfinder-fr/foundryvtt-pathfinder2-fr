------ Description (en) ------
<p>You&rsquo;re distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a &ndash;2 circumstance penalty to AC. Some effects give you the flat-footed condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others&mdash;especially conditions&mdash;can make you universally flat-footed against everything. If a rule doesn&rsquo;t specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say &ldquo;The target is flat-footed.&rdquo;</p>
