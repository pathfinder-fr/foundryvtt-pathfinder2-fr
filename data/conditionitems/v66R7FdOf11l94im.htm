------ Description (en) ------
<p>This condition reflects a creature&rsquo;s disposition toward a particular character, and it affects only creatures that are not player characters. A creature that is friendly to a character likes that character. The character can attempt to make a @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.DCb62iCBrJXy0Ik6]{Request} of a friendly creature, and the friendly creature is likely to agree to a simple and safe request that doesn&rsquo;t cost it much to fulfill. If the character or one of their allies uses hostile actions against the creature, the creature gains a worse attitude condition depending on the severity of the hostile action, as determined by the GM.</p>
