------ Description (en) ------
<p>When you are undetected by a creature, that creature cannot see you at all, has no idea what space you occupy, and can&rsquo;t target you, though you still can be affected by abilities that target an area. When you&rsquo;re undetected by a creature, that creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed] to you.<br /><br />A creature you&rsquo;re undetected by can guess which square you&rsquo;re in to try targeting you. It must pick a square and attempt an attack. This works like targeting a hidden creature (requiring a <strong>DC 11</strong> flat check, as described on page 466), but the flat check and attack roll are rolled in secret by the GM, who doesn&rsquo;t reveal whether the attack missed due to failing the flat check, failing the attack roll, or choosing the wrong square.<br /><br />A creature can use the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} action to try to find you, as described on page 471.</p>
