------ Description (en) ------
<p>Tidehawks, avian embodiments of the sea and rain, nest in deep underwater crevasses and glide among waves. They feed mostly on large sea life and rise above the surface during or in the aftermath of a rainstorm to bask in the fresh moisture of the air.</p>
<p>Though tidehawks hail from the same mystical family as the legendary phoenix, the two rarely interact due to their different outlooks and elemental affiliations. Phoenixes see tidehawks as flighty and unreliable, while tidehawks view their fiery kin as self-righteous do-gooders who can't resist meddling in mortal affairs. Only particularly evil threats to natural environments can bring them together.</p>
