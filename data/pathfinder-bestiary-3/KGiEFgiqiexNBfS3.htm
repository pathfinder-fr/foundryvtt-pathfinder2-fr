------ Description (en) ------
<p>These gaunt and insectile sahkils torment their foes by focusing on a widespread fear of insects and creeping, crawling vermin.&nbsp;Unlike their more subtle cousins, wihsaaks don&rsquo;t lurk in&nbsp;the periphery and instead directly engage&nbsp;their targets, using their unnerving&nbsp;buzzing to disorient and terrify.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When encountering multiple foes,&nbsp;wihsaaks attempt to spread fear to everyone before slashing at them with their&nbsp;devastating claws.</p>
