Name: Dybbuk
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>The discorporated spirits called dybbuks arise from souls denied respite in the afterlife, often because they committed some great transgression in life. A priest can appease dybbuks by helping them achieve some esoteric mission, though these tricksters are prone to deceiving anyone who offers them aid. Only by trapping, cowing, or destroying such spirits can a mortal hope to drive them back. Dybbuks hide within household objects or possessed victims. They particularly enjoy taking over the body of someone their target loves and then slowly destroying the lives of both.</p>
