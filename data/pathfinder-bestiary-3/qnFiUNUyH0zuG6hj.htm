------ Description (en) ------
<p>Quintessivores are cunning creatures that wield arcane magic and scalpel-sharp spider limbs that can rend one's soul just as easily as flesh. A quintessivore doesn't immediately kill its prey-it drags the creature to its lair and separates the victim's soul from their body with its bladed limbs. The flicking blades then pull out the creature's individuality, reducing the soul down to pure soul-stuff called quintessence, which the quintessivore then consumes.</p>
<h3>Quintessence</h3>
<p>Quintessence not only makes up a creature's soul, but also forms most of the planes of the Outer Sphere. Through the cycle of life and death, mortal souls travel to the Boneyard for judgment before moving on to their afterlives. After eons, souls lose their individuality and are recycled. Passed through the Maelstrom, the quintessence is broken down to pure potentiality, then reforms as new quintessence that sprouts in the Positive Energy Plane as the source of new souls.</p>
