Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Little is known of the strange creatures known as mothmen, save that when they make themselves known, calamity is sure to follow. The mothman sees themself as an agent of fate-provided such fate is devastating and destructive. Often, those who encounter a mothman never recall the meeting, yet live on to unknowingly pursue and enable the creature's obscure plans.</p>
<p>The name "mothmen" is, of course, not these creatures' own name for themselves, but an appellation granted by the fearful who glimpse them and tell harrowing tales of their sightings. They each keep their own names, or a collection for use in different situations, yet have no need for a collective word for their kind.</p>
