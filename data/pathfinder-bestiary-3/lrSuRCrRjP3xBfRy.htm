------ Description (en) ------
<p>Despite their long, hooked claws being one of their most distinctive features, sloths are herbivorous creatures. Smaller sloths use their claws to climb from tree to tree, seeking fruits and young leaves among the canopy. Larger species can reach up to 20 feet tall and weigh more than 10,000 pounds.</p>
<hr />
<p>Megatheriums dwell deep within ancient forests and humid jungles. Fiercely territorial, these immense creatures are often smelt before seen. Though they travel on all fours, megatheriums can reach foliage 20 feet above the forest floor by standing on their hind legs and short, thick tails. Their enormous foreclaws, used to bend tree limbs within reach of their mouths, can cleave a horse in two and crush its rider.</p>
<p>The musk of the megatherium serves as a warning to potential predators and other megatheriums that they're too close. Adult megatheriums are so territorial that most don't reproduce more than twice in their lifetime. Though the creatures regularly patrol their territory for intruders, they tend to avoid settlements unless food has become scarce. When they do stray into towns, they've been known to devour entire orchards in a day.</p>
