Name: Hadrinnex

------ Description (en) ------
<p>The bizarre hadrinnexes resemble defensive systems more than living creatures. They evolve at a rapid rate, but only to specific attacks against them, which suggests they were created through advanced technology or magic. The husk surrounding a hadrinnex-flecks of metal suspended in a malleable organic carapace-reshapes in response to harm. So too can a glowing gland within the creature's thorax, which collects energy and restructures the creature's biology to protect it from that energy. This organ is fragile and ruptures soon after a hadrinnex is killed.</p>
<p>Hadrinnexes have only a rudimentary intellect and usually follow more intelligent aberrations. As bodyguards or peons, they perform simple tasks diligently. Though poor at problem-solving and improvisation, hadrinnexes' dependability and adaptive physiology make them ideal for dangerous tasks in hazardous environments.</p>
