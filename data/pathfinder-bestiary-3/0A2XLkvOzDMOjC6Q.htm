------ Description (en) ------
<p>Intricate, complex machines, clockworks are built with care by highly skilled engineers. Though their creation involves some amount of magic, they&rsquo;re primarily mechanical, packed with precision-tuned gears and springs working in concert.</p>
<p>The sturdy mainspring within a clockwork must be wound to provide the energy needed to power the device. Some larger clockworks contain a series of springs for different limbs that each need to be wound. A clockwork&rsquo;s crafter creates a unique metal key while building the clockwork; winding the clockwork usually involves inserting the key into the machine&rsquo;s back and turning clockwise. Larger clockworks require greater strength to turn the key, and typically have larger keys to allow for more torque&mdash;some even accommodating a team of winders rather than an individual. Programming a clockwork requires both the key and the knowledge to set the program correctly, information usually reserved for the clockwork&rsquo;s creator or owner.</p>
<hr />
<p>A clockwork mage is a lethal blend of magic and machinery. Each of these clockworks is imbued with an arcane stone at its core that powers spells through the wand embedded in its chest.</p>
