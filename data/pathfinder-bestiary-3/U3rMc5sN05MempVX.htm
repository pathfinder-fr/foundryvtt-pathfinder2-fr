------ Description (en) ------
<p>Maftets are hawk-winged humanoids with leonine lower bodies that dwell in ancient ruins and cities thought lost, typically in desert or mountain regions. They view themselves as guardians and practice a specialized technique of dualwielding scimitars so central to their culture that a maftet&rsquo;s scimitars are often cherished family heirlooms. Most maftets venerate their ancestors in addition to various deities, and even a child can detail their family lineage back multiple generations. Maftet prides tend to be matriarchal and isolationist, though maftets aren&rsquo;t necessarily hostile to outsiders who respect their homes and don&rsquo;t seek to loot them.</p>
<p>When a young maftet comes of age, they receive runic tattoos from a pride&rsquo;s elder. These tattoos are imbued with magic that allows a maftet to enchant their wielded weapons, but the individualized designs tell of the maftet&rsquo;s ancestors, childhood adventures, and positive qualities. Such tattoos are considered sacred and never given to non-maftets.</p>
