------ Description (en) ------
<p>In the Dimension of Time, intense emotions are more than just ethereal feelings. They accumulate over time, from things like the critical mass of emotion caused by a historic event or a settlement passing down a powerful sentiment for generations. These accretions eventually give birth to siktemporas. Each siktempora feels, with all their being, a singular intense emotion linked to the circumstances that spawned them. A rare few, however, are created when an emotionally invested creature attempts to travel to the Dimension of Time or interferes with the flow of time, which can create paradoxes or manipulate past events.</p>
<p>Siktemporas usually isolate themselves on the Dimension of Time in mindscapes infused with the emotion that created them, but some travel to other planes. These wanderers long to indulge in more of their core emotion or to engender more of that feeling, thus perpetuating their own kind.</p>
<hr />
<p>Creatures born of intense pain and suffering, the armless, six-legged misery siktemporas are some of the most numerous of their kind since misery is as ubiquitous an experience as living. They&rsquo;re also the most proactive of siktemporas, seeking to propagate the misery from which they spawn. They delight in opportunities to travel to the Material Plane, where misery is so woefully prevalent and easily multiplied.</p>
