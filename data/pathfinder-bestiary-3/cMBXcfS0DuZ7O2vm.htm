------ Description (en) ------
<p>Pukwudgies go by many names in many regions, but those who know of them agree that defying their mischievous nature provokes their wrath.</p>
<p>In ancient times, pukwudgies traveled to the Material Plane from the First World, perhaps in the wake of the gnome emigration. These proud fey are obsessed with displays of respect, and while they first attempted to befriend mortals, each attempt ended in tragedy as the pukwudgies perceived any potential slight as a grave insult. Mortals, fearing these reactions, began to view pukwudgies as nuisances, and pukwudgies in turn began to resent mortals and the gods that favored them. At their best, pukwudgies play cruel jokes on mortals they encounter. At their worst, they've been known to kidnap and even kill those who don't treat them with proper respect.</p>
<p>Pukwudgies make their villages in the oldest forests, concealed under @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.HBJPsonQnWcC3qdX]{Hallucinatory Terrain} spells and @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.nA0XlPsnMNrQMpio]{Fantastic Facade} rituals. They travel freely between the Material Plane and the First World through tiny portals beneath hills, trees, or stones. No strangers to violence, pukwudgies rarely travel alone and often anoint their quills or weapons with a custom-brewed poison before entering hostile situations.</p>
<p>Standing about 2 feet tall, a pukwudgie sports sharp quills growing from their head that extends down their back. Their skin tone varies by the region in which they live, ranging from pale gray to brown.</p>
