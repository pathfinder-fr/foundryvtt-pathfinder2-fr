------ Description (en) ------
<p>Monkeys vary greatly in size, color, and behavior. Some are distinguished by bright orange fur, others for black fur in sharp contrast with a white face. Some produce distinct noises, like howls that can be heard from a village away. Others vie for dominance within ever-changing social hierarchies. Their size and aptitude for climbing allow them to quickly escape threats; combined with being a little too clever for their own good, this allows them to get up to all sorts of mischief and usually escape to do it again.</p>
<hr />
<p>When these small, curious primates come in contact with large humanoid populations, they quickly adapt, learning to steal food or small objects before retreating to the nearest tree branch with their prize.</p>
