<p>Elusive and shrewd, foxes have gained a reputation as sly tricksters, earning them a place in many folk tales.</p>
<hr />
<p>With fur that shifts between hues of red, dull brown, and silver as it moves, the fading fox vexes any pursuer. It has a knack for escaping traps, leaves no footprints, and seemingly disappears into thin air. Fading foxes have lustrous fur and a robust build that set them apart from their red fox progenitors.</p>
