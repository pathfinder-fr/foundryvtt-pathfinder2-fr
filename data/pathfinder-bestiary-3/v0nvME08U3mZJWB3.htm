------ Description (en) ------
<p>A betobeto-san wanders the highways and byways of the Material Plane, searching for unwilling traveling companions to sustain the spirit&rsquo;s appetite for fear. Though this shadow spirit is invisible in darkness or shade, in light they appear as a formless, shadowy mass with two sandaled feet. These sandals are made of wood or bone that cause the creature&rsquo;s footsteps to make the distinct &ldquo;beto beto&rdquo; sound from which they receive their name. A wide, toothy mouth smiles in the middle of their otherwise featureless mass, and they can manifest long, clawed limbs.</p>
<p>Betobeto-san trail behind nighttime travelers, compelled to follow until the creatures verbally offer to let the betobeto-san pass. This compulsion isn&rsquo;t usually malicious by nature and occurs more from a betobeto-san&rsquo;s misguided desire for company and courtesy; unfortunately, they lack of understanding how this behavior can frighten others. Betobeto-san don&rsquo;t attack those they follow, but they often end up in combat because their unwelcome behavior causes those they follow to attack first.</p>
