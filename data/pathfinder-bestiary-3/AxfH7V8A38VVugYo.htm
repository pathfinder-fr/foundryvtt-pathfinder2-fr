<p>Nymphs are fey guardians of nature possessed of great beauty and forms that&nbsp;meld breathtaking humanoid features with the natural elements they guard.&nbsp;Nymph queens are powerful nymphs who rule over and protect a much greater&nbsp;territory of untouched wilderness. For instance, a lampad might guard a&nbsp;beautiful underground cavern, but a lampad queen might call an entire system&nbsp;of caves their domain.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lampads protect dark, hidden places underground. Not only do they defend subterranean caverns from threats, but they also safeguard well-meaning innocents from the dangers that lurk below the surface. Lampads are so-named for the wisps of magic light they often carry, guiding the lost to safety while luring threats to their doom. Lampads&rsquo; mercurial nature makes their reactions difficult to predict, though they rarely demonstrate outright malice without sufficient provocation.</p>
