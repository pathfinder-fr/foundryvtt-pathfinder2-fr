Name: Sorcerous Skull Swarm
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>A skull swarm is composed of reanimated masses of craniums and jawbones, forming a terrifying avalanche of undead fury. Most skull swarms are mindless, though some retain a vestige of wit, awareness, and even magical talents from life, culminating in a highly intelligent swarm mind.</p>
<hr />
<p>The act of creating a demilich sometimes goes horribly awry, leaving behind a shattered remnant of a once-mighty spellcaster constantly leaking eldritch energies. The ruined spirit animates a cloud of debased copies of itself, glittering with cracked crystals in crude imitation, and it hungers constantly for the magical energies denied it in its corrupted immortality.</p>
<p>Some of the spellcaster's personality remains in the swarm, albeit usually unnaturally split between the skulls. As a consequence, the skulls argue among themselves as warring parts of the personality clamor to be heard, resulting in the swarm's fractious, inconstant attitude.</p>
