------ Description (en) ------
<p>A rumor can become so vivid and so persistent that it comes to life, creating a brainchild&mdash;a living illusion that hatches from an intense belief in a remorseless and implacable killer. Often, these rumors swirl around the victims of a phantasmal killer spell. A brainchild&rsquo;s capabilities grow when they pursue a believer but deflate against skeptics, making them only as bad as one thinks they are. A simple drive to stalk, terrify, and kill propels a brainchild, but the creature might also exhibit other behaviors ascribed to them through gossip.</p>
