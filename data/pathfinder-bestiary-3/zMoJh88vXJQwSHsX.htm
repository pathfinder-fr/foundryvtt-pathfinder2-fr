Name: Abandoned Zealot
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Once devout followers whose faith proved false, abandoned zealots return from the doorstep of the afterlife after being denied the eternal reward they expected. Consumed by self-loathing for the lives they squandered to false faiths and empty creeds, these lost souls serve as terrifying and implacable&mdash;yet ultimately pathetic&mdash;foes. A shapeless mass of smoke and shadow coils behind their broken masks. As abandoned zealots move, they spit and shriek a hateful cacophony of bitter lamentations and anguished weeping.</p>
<p>Abandoned zealots are most commonly associated with the church of Razmir, which upholds a mortal wizard as a god&mdash;a truth unknown to most worshippers. However, abandoned zealots might arise from a true religion if they&rsquo;ve been misled about that faith&rsquo;s true tenets or aims. This situation could easily result from the cruel schemes and predations of sinister beings, such as shrine skelms and the blasphemous devils known as deimaviggas.</p>
