<hr />
<p>Irrepressible vine leshys love to explore and collect tales to share. They're curious&nbsp;without being reckless. Other cultures interest them greatly, and they can build friendships quickly as they trade stories with traveling companions. They also feel a pull toward protection, much like other leshys. Vine leshys, though, tend to protect a ward for only a brief period of danger before the leshy's wanderlust drives them onward into the unknown.</p>
