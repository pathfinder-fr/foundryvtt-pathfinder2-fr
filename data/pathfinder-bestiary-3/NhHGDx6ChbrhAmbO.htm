------ Description (en) ------
<p>House spirits are shy, often helpful, sometimes wrathful fey that dwell alongside peasants and farmers. They reside in the house, in the yard, in the granary, in the bathhouse-wherever people build and live. Due to this proximity, house spirits often take on the mannerisms or appearance of nearby mortals. Their reclusive nature and tendency to go unseen earned them the moniker of "spirits," though in truth they are fully embodied fey.</p>
<p>House spirits take an almost parental interest in "their" mortals. Given proper respect, these fey work tirelessly for their charges-they chop wood, care for livestock, mend clothes, sweep the floor, and tend to the stove. If offended, though, the house spirit becomes a menace, frightening animals or children and ruining belongings.</p>
<hr />
<p>The elderly domovoi are patrons of the home and the dearest of all house spirits to the people they live with. Families with a domovoi leave a bowl of milk in the corner of the home in thanks, and peasants often take great pains to coax a domovoi to follow them to a new house.</p>
<p>An enraged domovoi rallies the home itself in their defense. Anything in the house could betray its residents. Crockery falls onto the heads of attackers, doors slam in their faces, carpets tangle their feet, and woe betide the attacker if someone has hung a sword on the wall.</p>
