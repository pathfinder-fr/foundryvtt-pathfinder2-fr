------ Description (en) ------
<p>Though they resemble pterosaurs and hail from a similar era, kongamatos are actually a primeval branch of dragonkind. They aren't particularly intelligent and lack the powerful magical abilities that many of their dragon kindred command, but a kongamato has a supernaturally strong beak that can punch through incredibly dense substances. While this beak might seem like a valuable trophy for hunters, its magic dies with the kongamato, and all attempts to integrate them into weapons have failed.</p>
<p>Though they dwell in swamps and other still waters, kongamatos prefer to hunt in rivers and streams, since running water delivers new prey on a regular basis. The predators hunt everything, and they are well aware their powerful beaks can sink boats and rafts. They even possess a semblance of draconic greed. While they care little for the material wealth or societal power, kongamatos claim large hunting territories, violently attacking any would-be rivals and ravenously slaughtering large animals in their territory, leaving carcasses half-eaten with little regard for whether they'll still have meals in the future.</p>
<p>When a kongamato claims a territory that encapsulates a community, the people there have no choice but to hunt down the vicious predator or hire adventurers to do so on their behalf. Kongamatos' hunger is such that a single one can devastate entire herds of livestock&nbsp;and threaten the safety of the entire community. Unlike their draconic relatives, kongamatos ignore attempts to bargain with them, and efforts to appease them through regular sacrifices have no effect.</p>
