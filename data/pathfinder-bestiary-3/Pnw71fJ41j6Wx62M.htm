------ Description (en) ------
<p>Catching a glimpse of a harmona is said to be lucky. Flying quickly, observing and scouting new areas, these brightly colored avian fey are all but hidden to the eye. A soft buzz accompanies them, discernible only to creatures with particularly keen hearing.</p>
<p>Intelligent and curious, these tiny fey birds freely roam the First World, accompanying high-ranking fey creatures such as queens or their courts. In turn, companions who treat a harmona with respect for their knowledge and skill benefit from the harmona&rsquo;s aid in times of need.</p>
<p>When these curious creatures find a natural gate between the planes, they glide through to explore and expand their knowledge. Those who find their&nbsp;way onto the Material Plane often choose to remain there in search of diverse and unusual places. This frequently leads them to the same locations that draw in curious adventurers. A harmona might befriend a non-fey adventurer as a companion, but they resent those who would treat them as pets and fight to the death to avoid capture.</p>
