------ Description (en) ------
<p>A skull swarm is composed of reanimated masses of craniums and jawbones, forming a terrifying avalanche of undead fury. Most skull swarms are mindless, though some retain a vestige of wit, awareness, and even magical talents from life, culminating in a highly intelligent swarm mind.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some skull swarms are crafted from the heads of feral and dangerous beasts. These can include predatory cats, bears, dinosaurs, and the like, but just as often they&rsquo;re made from bulls, horses, apes, and other creatures that were gentler in life. In death, a feral skull swarm is bloodthirsty regardless of its origins, with a keen scent for living flesh. Even herbivore skulls diligently chew on the flesh of their swarm&rsquo;s victims.</p>
