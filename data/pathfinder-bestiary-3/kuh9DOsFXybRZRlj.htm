Name: Tolokand
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Streams run dry. The earth cracks. Green leaves brown and shatter. And the creature walks on.</p>
<p>The faceless, unknowable tolokands wander the land, bringing desolation with every footfall&mdash;belching poisonous smoke, blighting plant life, cracking the earth asunder, and even staining the ground with their foul blood. They turn habitable places into wastelands, which has earned tolokands the name &ldquo;waste walkers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These walking forces of destruction don&rsquo;t make their motives known. They remain unmoved by any pleas or threats levied at them, and they fight off attacks only so that they can return to their grim business. However, they have one consistent tendency: they travel to environments on the brink. A tolokand appears in a land wracked by famine or a natural disaster to give it the last push into oblivion.</p>
<p>Tolokands are mercifully few in number. Since they appear so rarely, it&rsquo;s unclear whether there are just a few individuals or several dozen. Clearly, more than one exists, though, because their patterned soles are as distinctive as fingerprints. Often, these smoking footprints are all that remain in a blighted land.</p>
