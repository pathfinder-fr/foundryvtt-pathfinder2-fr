------ Description (en) ------
<p>These ancient denizens of the Shadow Plane appear as grayish humanoid torsos covered in translucent funeral veils of shadow. Silent and mysterious, they float about, absent legs to hold them aloft. Never speaking a word aloud, they instead reach into the minds of creatures around them to whisper and mumble curses, threats, and strange bits of forlorn augury.</p>
<p>These haunting creatures are revered by calignis as proxies of the Forsaken&mdash;a strange array of ancestor-like demigods whom many calignis worship. Some even believe owbs are the Forsaken manifested.</p>
<p>A multitude of owbs visit and even remain to advise caligni communities, as varied in personality as the Forsaken. All owbs share a hatred of light and color, except for the flickering glow of the burning cold magic they can hurl as a weapon. Owbs who live among calignis tend to prohibit the use of light and color, using their curse of darkness to quench violators if necessary. The only other similarity across all owbs is their entrenched desire to manipulate their charges through mind-reading and deception, though such manipulation can be either subtle or overt.</p>
<hr />
<p>An owb who comes into contact and is chosen by one of the Forsaken gains a fragment of that demigod&rsquo;s power and forges a permanent connection with it. This act transforms the owb into a larger, more powerful creature and imbues it with the power of divine transference, allowing the owb to gain followers and grant spells to them. These are owb prophets.</p>
<p>Owb prophets may have some portion of the Forsaken&rsquo;s power, but they use their authority to gain more sway over calignis and other worshippers.</p>
