Name: Gliminal
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Beholding the blinding light of a gliminal is akin to staring into the sun, and consequently, only gliminals themselves fully understand what they are or how they truly look. Gliminals exude a constant aura of positive energy, suffusing everything they encounter without regard for whether a creature's body can withstand these excesses of positive energy.</p>
<p>On the Positive Energy Plane they call home, gliminals view outsiders as unfortunate creatures afflicted with the malady called mortality. They seek to suffuse mortals with light and healing until they no longer suffer, and they consider those who explode into positive energy cured. Gliminals pulled to other planes, whether summoned or through interplanar rifts, find themselves overwhelmed, and usually lash out in increasingly desperate attempts to escape the oppressive onslaught of matter and negative energies.</p>
