Name: Nightmarchers

------ Description (en) ------
<p>While smooth roads remain a traveler&rsquo;s blessing, walking them after sunset risks nightmarcher attack. The ringing of conch shells and beating of drums herald the coming of these spirits as they walk the royal highways, unfettered by walls or barriers.</p>
<p>Nightmarchers react violently to those in their path. If a bystander is fortunate, an ancestor&rsquo;s spirit might call out to spare them. Those who refuse to show proper deference might be reduced to little more than ash on the wind come sunrise.</p>
