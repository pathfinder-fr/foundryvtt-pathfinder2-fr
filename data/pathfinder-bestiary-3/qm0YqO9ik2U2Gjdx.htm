------ Description (en) ------
<p>Foul creatures who appear as wizened old women, hags share little in common with the humanoids they terrorize. They are hateful entities whose greatest joy lies in the corruption and ultimate destruction of anything good and virtuous. Whatever power created the first hags is lost to time, but numerous hag varieties have arisen over the ages, each with their own powers and abilities to spread pain and suffering.</p>
<hr />
<p>Moon hags are powerful soothsayers who dwell in places where souls receive&nbsp;their final judgment. These vile creatures possess knowledge of-and perhaps some power over-the portals between the lands of the living and the dead, and innocent mortals sometimes seek them out for this reason. Moon hags use their knowledge to sow discord and place seeds of doubt in those who unwittingly seek their aid. Beings of great power can intimidate them into sharing the truth of what they know, but the cunning hags always try to hide some important piece of information or word things in such a way that anyone acting on their divinations still find their plans falling into ruin.</p>
