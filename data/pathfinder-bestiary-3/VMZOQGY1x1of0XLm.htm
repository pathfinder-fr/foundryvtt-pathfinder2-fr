<p>Spirit guides are a distinctive form of spiritual entity with a tenuous attachment to the Material Plane. Some legends say that the first spirit guides were the perfect conceptual forms of animals, and that from them, eagles, foxes, bears, and other mortal animals were born. Each guide displayed an interest in mortal affairs, watching over communities and imparting their gifts. Fox shared his cunning with the mortals he befriended, while Bear taught them how to survive and endure.</p>
<p>Over the passing of countless mortal generations, new spirit guides were born, many of them possessing traits from two or more of the original spirit guides. In the ancient human nation of Sarkoris, the people abandoned the worship of traditional gods in favor of venerating the spirit guides who watched over them. While the people of some neighboring nations saw this as heresy, to the old Sarkorians, this worship was perfectly natural. The same beings who had taught their forebears lessons that allowed them to survive and thrive still walked among them.</p>
<p>Spirit guides can form bonds with mortal partners. While many spirit guides create a permanent bond with a mortal, such as the relationship between the spirit guides of Sarkoris and the mortal spiritual leaders known as god callers, some instead form temporary bonds, either to test the prospective mortal before committing or because a permanent bond is undesirable. It's not uncommon for a single spirit guide to form bonds with recurring generations of a family or community, protecting and guiding mortals they've grown fond of or who do them a great service.</p>

<p>Spirit guides of cunning are often seen as the weakest of the spirit guides, but are also the most numerous and proactive, guiding families to safe paths or leaving food and water for warriors. Cunning guides often take the form of foxes.</p>
