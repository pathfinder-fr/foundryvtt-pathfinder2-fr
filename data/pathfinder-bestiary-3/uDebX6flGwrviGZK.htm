------ Description (en) ------
<p>Nymphs are fey guardians of nature possessed of great beauty and forms that meld breathtaking humanoid features with the natural elements they guard. Nymph queens are powerful nymphs who rule over and protect a much greater territory of untouched wilderness. For instance, a lampad might guard a beautiful underground cavern, but a lampad queen might call an entire system of caves their domain.</p>

<p>Hesperid queens rule over isolated regions soaked in the light of sunset. They guard countless treasures and secrets, though for those who approach them with respect and offer an intriguing bargain, they&rsquo;re willing to part with knowledge or items beyond those secrets or valuables they&rsquo;ve sworn to keep to themselves.</p>
<p>Hesperid queens are relatively likely to have powerful objects under their protection, such as ancient relics or artifacts. As such, they&rsquo;re keenly aware of the danger posed by unscrupulous treasure hunters seeking to obtain these items at any cost, and they use their incredible minds to set up devious countermeasures to protect their wards, even in the event of their own deaths.</p>
