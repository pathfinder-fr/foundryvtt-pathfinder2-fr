------ Description (en) ------
<p>Tooth fairies spawn when a child&rsquo;s tooth (or, less commonly, an entire child) is buried in terrain rife with fey energies. Hatching from the buried teeth like larvae from an egg, tooth fairies build crude pliers from whatever they can find, then go hunting for more teeth&mdash;regardless of the owners&rsquo; willingness.</p>
<hr />
<p>A mob of tooth fairies working together can conduct forced dentistry in seconds.</p>
