------ Description (en) ------
<p>Chyzaedus&rsquo; home world was consumed millennia ago by the Dominion of the Black via the manipulation of a black hole. Rather than accept destruction or fight back, the chyzaedus instead joined forces with their destroyers, seeing in them a greater purpose than mere world domination. Today, chyzaedus serve in a role akin to a priesthood for the Dominion and take a sinister interest in bringing their beliefs to new worlds, teaching ignorant dwellers the glory of pure entropic destruction. Much like the black holes they venerate, chyzaedus possess an eternal hunger for sustenance and knowledge alike&mdash;they can never be sated by either, yet they will never starve as long as there are mortals whose energy they can feed upon.</p>
