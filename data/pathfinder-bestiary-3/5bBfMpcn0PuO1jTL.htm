Name: Lava Worm Swarm
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>The humble bore worm is a small and simple creature, both biologically and magically. These qualities allow it to adapt rapidly to different environments, some of them quite extreme, and also makes it susceptible to magical radiation and experimentation. Many a Darklands apprentice takes their first steps in the school of transmutation by practicing on these worms, while variations&mdash;both natural and cultivated&mdash;are scattered about beneath Golarion&rsquo;s surface.</p>
<p>Dwelling in the deepest, hottest reaches of the Darklands, these bizarre creatures consume not living matter but minerals and rare earths. They&rsquo;re most often found near volcanoes or open magma and will swim through the lava in pursuit of a meal. Lava worms are immune to fire rather than to acid, and they substitute fire for acid in all of their attacks and abilities.</p>
