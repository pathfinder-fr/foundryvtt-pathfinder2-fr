------ Description (en) ------
<p>Weasels are lithe, clever predators known for both their beautiful, sleek fur and their ability to crawl into tight spaces. Pound for pound, few animals are as voracious as weasels. Insatiably hungry, they eat almost half their own weight each day, leading them to constantly hunt for new prey to satisfy their hunger.</p>
<hr />
<p>These giant weasels are driven by the same hunger that plagues their smaller cousins, but because of their much larger size, they can quickly devastate the wildlife in an environment. They tend to avoid humanoids but have been known to attack if driven by hunger or fear.</p>
<p>A megalictis uses the same constricting bite as smaller weasels, remaining attached even if other creatures attack. Given their remarkable stature, a megalictis can take down sizable prey, including horses and even the occasional bear, if the opportunity presents itself.</p>
<p>A megalictis can grow to be 5 feet long and weighs around 150 pounds.</p>
