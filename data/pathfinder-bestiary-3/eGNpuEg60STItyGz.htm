------ Description (en) ------
<p>Often found assisting practitioners of nature magic, leshys are sentient flora that protect the natural world and sacred spaces within forests, fields, and other environments. Leshys are nature spirits inhabiting bodies constructed of plant matter fused together by a primal ritual.</p>
<hr />
<p>These little plants are known for their nettlesome attitude. Their personalities mirror the spines that sprout from all over their bodies, making them cantankerous and slightly prickly, though they are unswervingly loyal to those who earn their trust. At home in dry and arid landscapes, cactus leshys store water inside their bodies in order to survive these harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Cactus leshys come in all different shapes and colors: tall and thin, with beautiful, vibrantly colored blooms on their heads; squat and rotund, with rows and rows of orderly spines; or seemingly haphazard, with flat segments stacked end to end as if they were balancing on one another.</p>
