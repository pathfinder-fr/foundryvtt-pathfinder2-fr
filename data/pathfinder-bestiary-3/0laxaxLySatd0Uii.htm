------ Description (en) ------
<p>Imperial dragons, namesake of the Dragon Empires and guardians of Tian Xia before humanity arrived, embody five strengthening and counteracting forces. Unlike other true dragons, imperial dragons dive deep into human affairs. Some remain secretive, posing as reclusive hermits, while others keep a high profile, openly ruling factions. Tian cultures in turn venerate the dragons, depicting gods in the form of dragons or claiming ancestry from them. Not all are adored, for plenty of these creatures act wickedly.</p>
<p>DRACONIC CYCLES</p>
<p>Five elements underpin the magical powers of imperial dragons, influencing their relationships to all things and, especially, to others of their kind. These elements interlink in two cycles. In the first cycle, each element feeds one other: wood feeds fire, fire feeds earth, earth feeds metal, metal feeds water, and water feeds wood. In the second cycle, each element counters another: wood counters earth, earth counters water, water counters fire, fire counters metal, and metal counters wood.</p>
<p>Each imperial dragon represents one element and has four abilities related to the cycle. For example, the forest dragon&mdash;linked to wood&mdash;feeds fire, is fed by water, counters earth, and is countered by metal.</p>
<hr />
<p>The most well-known of imperial dragons due to their deep involvement with mortals, the sovereign dragons&rsquo; name comes from their mandate of selecting rulers&mdash;but at some point, the dragons themselves joined the list of worthy candidates. Other imperial dragons suspect the sovereign dragons offered their connection to the elemental cycle to attain forbidden magic, evidenced by their lack of any vulnerability to wood or ability to feed on fire, despite being creatures of the earth.</p>
<p>Most hesitate to question the sovereigns&rsquo; authority. While some appreciate their impartial nature, others fault this adherence to neutrality. Regardless, the sovereign dragons&rsquo; charm and centuries of experience in subtle manipulation have made them exceptional negotiators.</p>
<p>Almost all sovereign dragons appear gold in color. Their hair ranges from common colors found among humans to bright reds, greens, or blues. They&rsquo;re the only dragons with five digits per claw, a mark of special importance. Other imperial dragons dismiss this claim to status and instead tease the sovereign dragons over their need to wear armor, even while in their draconic forms.</p>
