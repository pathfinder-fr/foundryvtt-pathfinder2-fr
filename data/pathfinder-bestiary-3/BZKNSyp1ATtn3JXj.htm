Name: Adachros

------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a nascent demiplane fails to coalesce, its quintessence sometimes collapses into an adachros, a dangerous entity that combines overwhelming mental potential with no exposure to alternate viewpoints. Some of these megalomaniacal beings are tyrants, creating illusory kingdoms populated by abducted creatures forced to validate the creator's views. A more altruistic adachros might seek out pupils to reeducate and advise-though often without their consent-while always pushing their students to accept whatever unique philosophy was involved in their creation. An adachros might abandon disciples who spurn them, but more often, they become a bitter enemy, intent on destroying the perceived heretics.</p>
