Name: Nightgaunt

Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Nightgaunts dwell in dreams, lurking in wait to spirit away the unwary dreamer. Once connected to such a being, the nightgaunt feeds upon the mortal's emotions before abandoning them-often in places they might never wake from.</p>
<p>A nightgaunt appears as a bony humanoid with inky black skin, batlike wings, a long sinuous tail, and demonic horns atop a skull that lacks any face or features. Most nightgaunts have little interest in anything other than sating their hunger for emotions. They find the art of inducing nightmares to be a surefire way to feast, but they're even more adept at tormenting their victims to awful extremes through tickling while carrying them at precarious heights.</p>
<p>Nightgaunts often gather in vast colonies in the Dreamlands, where they entertain each other by sharing emotion-memories of their meals through strange caresses. These colonies pose great danger to any adventurer foolish enough to approach.</p>
<p>When conjured forth into other worlds, they serve only grudgingly, often working as hard to find a way to escape servitude and feed on their conjurer's emotions as they do on the task they've been compelled to perform.</p>
