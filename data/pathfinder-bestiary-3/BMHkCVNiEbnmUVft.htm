------ Description (en) ------
<p>Kami are divine nature spirits native to the lands of Tian Xia, far to the east of the Inner Sea region. They serve as guardians of natural objects and places they protect&mdash;their &ldquo;wards&rdquo;&mdash;and are ancient enemies of the oni. Kami can merge with their wards, allowing them to surreptitiously watch anyone who treads upon their sacred grounds. Kami leave those who they deem harmless alone, but the spirits fight vigilantly to scare away anyone perceived as a threat.</p>
<p>Kami choose their own wards, though many mortals seek to attract them to sites that might require protection, leading to a proliferation of certain trees, statues, gates, and other symbolic elements in areas where kami are known to dwell.</p>
<hr />
<p>Toshigami are especially powerful kami who protect cherry trees, particularly ones in places where the primeval powers of nature remain strong. The cycle of blossoming, flourishing, and wilting that cherry trees exhibit provides a striking visual metaphor for toshigami, who wield immense powers over growth, decay, and even time.</p>
<p>Also known as blossom kami, toshigami have a particular fascination with mortals. Many folk legends tell of toshigami who bestow their blessing unto worthy individuals who fight for just causes. Likewise, it isn&rsquo;t unheard of for toshigami to aid virtuous souls in dire need of healing or restoration. In truth, blossom kami are so rare and enigmatically aloof that few mortals have ever encountered such beings. Decades, even centuries, might pass before a humble village realizes that a toshigami inhabits its beloved cherry tree.</p>
<p>The stories persist, however, as they have for ages, leading to a widespread appreciation for cherry trees. The site of a new village might be chosen due to its proximity to an ancient cherry tree, and cherry trees are planted and carefully tended in larger population centers, both for their beauty and out of respect for the blossom kami. Should a toshigami choose one such tree as their ward, so much the better for the entire community.</p>
