Name: Leng Ghoul
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>In the icy nightmare dimension of Leng, ghouls with hoofed feet gather in morbid groups to worship and research, forming societies that mockingly mimic (and in their opinion, surpass) those of the living. Most worship the malevolent gods of the Elder Mythos and see the living as little more than fodder who will eventually die and provide memories for Leng ghouls to consume and absorb. Not all Leng ghouls are evil, but most are, and even those who aren&rsquo;t possess sardonic senses of humor and grisly appetites that make them disturbing allies at best.</p>
