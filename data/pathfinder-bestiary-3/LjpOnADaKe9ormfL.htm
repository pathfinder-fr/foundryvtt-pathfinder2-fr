------ Description (en) ------
<p>A kuchisake-onna, or slit-mouthed woman, is a tall, masked figure who moves with an eerie grace. These horrors are infamous for trapping hapless mortals and asking them, &ldquo;Am I pretty?&rdquo; A &ldquo;no&rdquo; response leads to a gruesome death wrought by the silver scissors the kuchisake-onna carries. A &ldquo;yes&rdquo; prompts them to remove their mask, revealing the scars and cuts running from ear to ear, giving the impression of a terrible, ever-present grin. They then open their mouth to reveal sharp, needle-like teeth and ask another question: &ldquo;Even now?&rdquo; A &ldquo;no&rdquo; leads to the same gory death, while a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; prompts them to use their silver scissors and make the same cuts on the target&rsquo;s face while repeating: &ldquo;Then I will make you like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are a handful of methods to weasel out of this otherwise no-win scenario. Answering noncommittally, saying the kuchisake-onna looks &ldquo;okay,&rdquo; or throwing several small, countable objects like rice or candy often provides enough time to run while the monster is distracted. Few are foolish enough to attack the kuchisake-onna, and those that live to tell the tale speak of a flashing flurry of scissor blades that match even a swordmaster&rsquo;s prowess.</p>
