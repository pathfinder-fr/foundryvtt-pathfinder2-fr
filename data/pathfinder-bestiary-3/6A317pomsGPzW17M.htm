<p>Although the subterranean Darklands are known for their cruel and domineering civilizations&mdash;led by fiend-worshipping drow, urdefhans, and&nbsp;others&mdash;that dwell within those sinister caverns, not every such subterranean society is ruled that way. Munavris are perhaps the best example of a people that tend to treat new arrivals to their Darklands territories with good temper, fairness, and respect.</p>
<p>These humanoids are the descendants of humans who survived the world-ending cataclysm called Earthfall&mdash;mariners who were abducted by alghollthus and dragged down through the ocean depths until they emerged on the other side of the seafloor, amid the Sightless Sea in the lightless realm of Orv.</p>
<p>Gradually, munavris&rsquo; bodies adapted to their new home: they lost the pigments in their hair and skin, developed highly sensitive vision, and began to demonstrate telekinetic powers. These early munavris eventually settled on a mysterious archipelago of jade islands&mdash;mystical green landforms that seemed to resonate with strange, psychic energies that repelled their alghollthu captors. Safe from their abductors and nurtured by the strange powers of their jade islands, munavris have remained free to hone their telekinetic abilities into substantial psychic prowess.</p>
<p>Every munavri has the ability to concentrate psychic energy upon an object to immediately ascertain what it is and how it works. Such natural intuition doesn&rsquo;t come easily, though; using this power requires the munavri to expend a large portion of their limited psychic energy. Sleep is the only way for a munavri to replenish this psychic well.</p>
<p>Today, nearly all munavris dwell on these islands and ply the waters of the Sightless Sea. Their predominant culture promotes nobility of both deed and heart, and many munavri dedicate their lives to waging war against those who sew discord in the Darklands.</p>
