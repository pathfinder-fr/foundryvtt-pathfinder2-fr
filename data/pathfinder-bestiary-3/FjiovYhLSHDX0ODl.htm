------ Description (en) ------
<p>Tattoo guardians are vigilant protectors drawn onto the skin of the individuals they are meant to protect. The creators of tattoo guardians typically animate them as they apply the tattoo using specific rituals and specialized inks, though more obscure rituals can animate a tattoo that&rsquo;s already been applied. Regardless of their animating method, tattoo guardians can temporarily remove themselves from their ward&rsquo;s skin and attack or even interpose themselves between their ward and any dangers. Most tattoo guardians remain on their ward and attack without separating.</p>
<p>Tattoo guardians come in a variety of forms, taking the shape of religious symbols, powerful creatures, or more abstract shapes. Magic reinforces the bond between a tattoo guardian and its ward, and the death of the ward also brings about the tattoo guardian&rsquo;s destruction. A guardian that is destroyed while its ward lives reverts to a mundane tattoo&mdash;often scarred or otherwise marred.</p>
<p>Familial or cultural traditions contribute to the meaning of a tattoo guardian&rsquo;s appearance. In many dwarven cultures, a given family or clan develops their own tattoo patterns and uses these in any tattoo guardians they make. It&rsquo;s especially common for members getting tattooed to ask for a tattoo patterned after one worn by a parent or other ancestor they greatly respect.</p>
