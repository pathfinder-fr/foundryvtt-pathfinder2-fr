<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mortal souls that have been twisted and corrupted by sin sometimes arise in the afterlife as demons. These powerful and destructive fiends seek to spread their particular sin to warp more souls, hereby bolstering their numbers and continuing the cycle.</p>
<hr />
<p>Seemingly made from living, animated filth, omoxes have no true anatomy, although they generally spend most of their time in roughly humanoid shapes, resembling some grim caricatures of half-melted humanoids. While scholars once believed these foul demons to be a pure, concentrated form of the corruption that suffuses the Abyss and its inhabitants, in truth these demons arise from the souls of those who routinely befouled and polluted their surroundings in life.</p>
