Name: Kirin

Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>The rare and majestic antlered beast known as a kirin supposedly appear only in times of peace and prosperity or during the birth or death of a great sage. Thus, encountering a kirin is a sign of great fortune, success, and prosperity to come. Conversely, finding a kirin&rsquo;s corpse or witnessing their death is a portent of tragedy and misfortune. A kirin&rsquo;s song always precedes the sighting of one of these graceful creatures, a sound often mistaken for wind chimes gently dancing in the breeze.</p>
<p>Kirin are chimeric creatures with the body of a stag, the tail of an ox, two horns atop their heads, and the scales and vibrant coloration of a dragon. Their majestic manes and beards constantly flow in the breeze, even on days with no wind, and sometimes appear wreathed in flames.</p>
<p>As creatures that treasure life, kirin don&rsquo;t consume flesh, and they take great care not to kill even a single insect beneath their cloven hooves. They&rsquo;re the embodiment of peace yet will quickly strike down evil with a powerful thrust of their horns, knowing that their acts preserve the peace for those who might otherwise come to harm.</p>
<p>Legends tell of particularly pious champions who have persuaded kirin to partner with them as mounts, though accomplishing such a feat is even rarer than the kirin.</p>
