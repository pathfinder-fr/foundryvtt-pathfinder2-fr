------ Description (en) ------
<p>Fearsome predators and durable pests, eurypterids are hard-carapaced arthropods sometimes referred to as sea scorpions. Though aquatic creatures, they have robust respiratory systems that allow them to survive indefinitely on land. All eurypterids possess claws as well as stingers that can inject venom.</p>
<hr />
<p>The smallest of the giant eurypterids can grow to about the size of a large dog. These eurypterids are a staple food for people living in marshlands, who add the meat to heavily spiced stews, but they&rsquo;re otherwise considered dangerous pests.</p>
