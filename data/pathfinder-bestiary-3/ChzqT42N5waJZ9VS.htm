------ Description (en) ------
<p>Fearsome predators and durable pests, eurypterids are hard-carapaced arthropods sometimes referred to as sea scorpions. Though aquatic creatures, they have robust respiratory systems that allow them to survive indefinitely on land. All eurypterids possess claws as well as stingers that can inject venom.</p>
<hr />
<p>Spiny eurypterids are aggressive, tenacious, and utterly unwilling to stop chasing prey, even to their own detriment. These creatures are covered with countless needle-like spikes and can grow to rival the size of ocean mammals like orcas. Sailors often find them clinging to the hulls of ships, as spinyeurypterids mistake them for prey and are too stubborn to let go.</p>
