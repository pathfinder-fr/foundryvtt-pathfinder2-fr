Name: Squirrel Swarm

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Squirrels&rsquo; ability to dart into sticky situations, extract berries or nuts from the most precarious of circumstances, and then hide their loot from prying eyes make them nature&rsquo;s thieves in trees. Their cute appearance&mdash;soft fur, big eyes, and fluffy tails&mdash;makes them inconspicuous and endearing, at least to some. Their reputation among humanoids is split between those who consider them cute little creatures and others who believe they&rsquo;re vermin.</p>
<p>Usually no more than a nuisance on their own, they can become a dangerous annoyance under the command of a druid, fey, or other creature that practices nature magic or is otherwise tied to the natural world. With their ability to reach remote places, excellent eyesight, and adept problem-solving, squirrels can perform effective reconnaissance for druids.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color: var(--body);">Descending with a shriek, a swarm of squirrels is a menace to foes, crawling in and out of pockets and clothing, biting and scratching as it goes. Though squirrels are usually independent, they might form into swarms when cornered or if a predator creates enough of a recurring threat that the little creatures need to gang up.</span></p>
