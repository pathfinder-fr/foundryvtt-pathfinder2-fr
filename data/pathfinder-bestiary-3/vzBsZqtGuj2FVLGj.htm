Name: Nucol
Nom: 
État: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Representing the fear of parasites and affliction, nucols appear as violent, pestilence-ridden boars. They pollute their victim's body and mind, spreading not only fear but a mind-altering affliction that exacerbates feelings of self‑doubt.</p>
<p>Though very aggressive, the fiends are capable of cunning manipulation. After they infect a victim with potent insecurity, they'll offer to remove the affliction for a price. Many of these deals are esoteric in nature, driving the victim into despair and forcing them to give up things they cherish. The sinister nucol may even reinfect its victim after completing the bargain, but a canny negotiator may be able to turn the tables on the fiend and free themselves from its grasp.</p>
