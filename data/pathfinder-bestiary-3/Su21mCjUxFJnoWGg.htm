------ Description (en) ------
<p>Azers are an elemental people living on the Plane of Fire, often crudely described by mortals as brassy dwarves. They have stout, wide bodies with broad shoulders, shining metallic skin, and heads wreathed in flame.</p>
<p>Azer society is organized into traditional roles inherited along their familial lines, and an azer&rsquo;s role is indicated clearly by the metals they wear in their armored kilts. Their culture focuses on tradition and history, placing high value on obedience and conformity within one&rsquo;s community, and as a result it is slow to change. Many azers take pride in their ancestral roles and in fulfilling their inherited duties, providing needed services within their communities.</p>
<p>Long ago, traditional azer values of self-sufficiency and close community led them to build mighty fortresses across the Plane of Fire, where they isolated themselves from other planar denizens and even other azer communities. These values, sadly, also led to their downfall. Without any connections to or regular communication with other settlements, these fortresses were easily conquered by the efreet of the City of Brass, the dominant power on the Plane of Fire. Now most azer fortresses lie abandoned and ruined, with free holds so few and far between that most think them all lost.</p>
<p>Azers born within the efreeti Dominion of Flame belong to the&nbsp; populations that were conquered and assimilated into the empire ages ago. They live in perpetual service to the empire, disconnected from their history and culture, yet have formed their own close-knit society in the City of Brass under the fire genies&rsquo; harsh rule.</p>
<p>A handful of azer communities have escaped efreeti conquest, most often by fleeing far from the genies&rsquo; realms. Some of these azers now reside in hot, volcanic areas of the Darklands on the Material Plane, while others have fled to the remote depths within the Plane of Fire or made strange bargains with conniving allies or unknowable entities to keep themselves hidden. Prying outsiders nevertheless perpetually seek out these settlements, longing for legendary azer-crafted goods.</p>
