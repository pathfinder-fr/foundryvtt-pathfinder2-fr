------ Description (en) ------
<p>Originally created as sapient magical servants, wyrwoods reclaimed the means&nbsp;to make more of their kind from their oppressive originators; now, they fiercely&nbsp;defend their freedom and autonomy. These small, nimble living machines rely&nbsp;on their wits and speed to evade foes and gather information. Most wyrwoods&nbsp;are precise and calculating, to the point that many outsiders perceive them as&nbsp;unfeeling, but they're also highly curious and passionate about matters that pique&nbsp;their interest. Regardless of personal agenda, wyrwoods prioritize the survival of&nbsp;their people above all else, even to the detriment of others when necessary.</p>
<p>Despite gaining their freedom, wyrwoods struggle to establish a home in&nbsp;Avistan. Some Avistani still view wyrwoods as tools of a secretive cabal, while&nbsp;others consider them traitorous servants who turned on their creators. Fearing&nbsp;for their safety, many wyrwoods fled the Inner Sea region to create a new home&nbsp;in Arcadia. In the coastal city of Segada, wyrwoods live in relative peace and&nbsp;safety, but they still prefer insular lifestyles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given their extreme self-reliance, wyrwoods have learned a degree of&nbsp;adaptability that far surpasses that of other cultures. When a wyrwood&nbsp;community finds itself in need of a specific skill or function, a member of the&nbsp;community-either a volunteer or one selected communally-takes it upon&nbsp;themself to learn the required abilities. They don't view any task as lesser or&nbsp;demeaning, as hubris is foreign to a wyrwood's construct nature.</p>
<p>A wyrwood's soul is tied to the magical stone that serves as their heart,&nbsp;which sometimes survives even when their construct body&nbsp;perishes. Another wyrwood might take the surviving heart&nbsp;from a close companion and incorporate it into their own&nbsp;body. In some cases, multiple wyrwoods might live on&nbsp;in a single body.</p>

<p>Wyrwood sneaks specialize in moving unseen&nbsp;behind enemy lines, performing reconnaissance&nbsp;and quietly eliminating threats.</p>
