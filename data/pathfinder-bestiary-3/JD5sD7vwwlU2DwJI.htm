Name: Angazhani
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Angazhanis lurk in the depths of the world&rsquo;s jungles, where these sapient, four-armed apes prey on any creatures they deem lesser than themselves. They&rsquo;re purportedly the divine minions of Angazhan, demon lord of apes. While many angazhanis do worship this foul god, scarce evidence exists to support their claim to fiendish heritage. Jungle-dwelling people know well to steer clear of suspected angazhani territories; angazhanis of such areas don&rsquo;t slaughter outright, often capturing trespassers to serve as slaves or as living sacrifices in heinous rituals.</p>
