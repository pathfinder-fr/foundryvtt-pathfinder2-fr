------ Description (en) ------
<p>Rakshasas are evil spirits who cloak themselves in the guises of humanoid creatures, that they might walk unseen among their prey. They often seek to shape and corrupt society from within.</p>
<hr />
<p>The most powerful of all rakshasas, maharajas form very rarely, never more than once or twice a century, and only from the reincarnated spirits of other powerful and wicked rakshasas. The birth of a new maharaja rakshasa is a momentous occasion, and less powerful rakshasas will seek to curry favor with the new maharaja at an early age. Each maharaja rakshasa is unique and boasts their own selection of spells. All are generally humanoid save for their many heads, which always number at least four and can range up to a dozen. One of these heads tends to be humanoid, while the others take the forms of cats, snakes, and other predatory animals.</p>
