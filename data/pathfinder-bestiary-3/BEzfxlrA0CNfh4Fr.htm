Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Among the most ancient of vampires are the nosferatus, twisted remnants of&nbsp;mortals who died in great plagues of old. Perhaps because of their age, nosferatus&nbsp;can no longer create more of their kind. Yet they still lurk among the living,&nbsp;manipulating the hearts and minds of their prey to either serve them beyond the&nbsp;limits of natural life or to become sustenance for the nosferatu like so many others&nbsp;before.</p>
<hr />
<p>Twisted by age and eternal hunger, nosferatu malefactors spread plague in their wake and yearn for mortal blood.</p>
