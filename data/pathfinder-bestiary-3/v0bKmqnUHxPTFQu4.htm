------ Description (en) ------
<p>Nymphs are fey guardians of nature possessed of great beauty and forms that meld breathtaking humanoid features with the natural elements they guard. Nymph queens are powerful nymphs who rule over and protect a much greater territory of untouched wilderness. For instance, a lampad might guard a beautiful underground cavern, but a lampad queen might call an entire system of caves their domain.</p>

<p>Hesperides are nymphs of sunset, guardians of the colorful golden hues of the setting sun. They live on remote islands, isolated coastal cliffsides, and hidden valleys, all places where the sunset&rsquo;s golden glow can have the strongest effect. Hesperides manipulate sunlight with dancelike motions, allowing them to create graceful ribbons of light at close range and searing rays at a distance.</p>
<p>Due to their connection to the beauty of the daily cycle of the setting sun, hesperides feel a satisfaction from methodical routine that can feel alien to wilder, more chaotic fey.</p>
