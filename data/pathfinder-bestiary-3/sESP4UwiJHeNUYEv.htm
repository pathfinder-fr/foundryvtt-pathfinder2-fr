------ Description (en) ------
<p>Monkeys vary greatly in size, color, and behavior. Some are distinguished by&nbsp;bright orange fur, others for black fur in sharp contrast with a white face. Some&nbsp;produce distinct noises, like howls that can be heard from a village away. Others&nbsp;vie for dominance within ever-changing social hierarchies. Their size and aptitude&nbsp;for climbing allow them to quickly escape threats; combined with being a little&nbsp;too clever for their own good, this allows them to get up to all sorts of mischief&nbsp;and usually escape to do it again.</p>
<hr />
<p>A single monkey can cause mischief. A troop of monkeys, emboldened by their numbers, can cause utter chaos, attacking anyone and looting anything in sight before scattering away with whatever they can carry.</p>
