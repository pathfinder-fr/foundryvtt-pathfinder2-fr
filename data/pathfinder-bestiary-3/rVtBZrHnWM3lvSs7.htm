Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>These goat-headed demons have glowing red eyes and flaming hooves but measure only about 3 feet in height. Born from the souls of arsonists, the fiery brimoraks continue the work they pursued in life, as everything they touch quickly burns.</p>
<p>As a general rule, brimoraks are ill-tempered even for demons, although their spite turns to glee in the face of a growing fire. Those who have survived encounters with these fiends report that they remember the braying sound of the brimoraks&rsquo; laughter as clearly as the heat of the flames or the choking scent of smoke.</p>
