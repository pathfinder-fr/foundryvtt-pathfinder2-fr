Name: Tzitzimitl
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Due to their affinity for darkness and apocalyptic terror, tzitzimitls are widely&nbsp;feared as harbingers of death and destruction. A solar eclipse marks their arrivals,&nbsp;and they draw strange powers of darkness and electricity from these phenomena.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some sages believe tzitzimitls to be instruments of the gods, called down to&nbsp;destroy worlds whose times have come, while others claim they're the undead&nbsp;remains of stranded exiles from a far-off civilization of spacefaring giants. The&nbsp;legends that include them are ancient and fragmented, but some tell of tzitzimitls&nbsp;being defeated by great heroes and sealed away-though these tales imply that&nbsp;the enormous undead now lie buried and waiting, soon to rampage again should&nbsp;their tombs be breached.</p>
