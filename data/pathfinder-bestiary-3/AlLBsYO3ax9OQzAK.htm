------ Description (en) ------
<p>A tupilaq is an artistically crafted construct carved from animal bones (typically&nbsp;whale or walrus) and imbued with the express purpose of eviscerating its creator&rsquo;s&nbsp;enemies. A tupilaq manifests from hateful magic&mdash;a thing that can be created&nbsp;only by someone who believes they were grievously wronged. When a terrible,&nbsp;unforgivable crime is committed against someone with great skill at carving and&nbsp;who has knowledge of the proper ritual, the aggrieved can channel their grief and&nbsp;hate through whispered incantations to bring a tupilaq to life.</p>
<p>Sadly, the same emotions used to create a tupilaq often lead to even greater&nbsp;tragedies. Functionally immortal but built for vengeance a tupilaq lacks the&nbsp;reason or discernment to do anything other than pursue the goal imbued by its&nbsp;creator. A wish to utterly destroy an enemy can lead a tupilaq to slaughter an&nbsp;entire clan or settlement, killing until it has slain everyone even remotely related&nbsp;to the original offender. There are many stories where a tupilaq ends up causing&nbsp;more tragedy for its creator than the crime that precipitated its creation. The&nbsp;most common tales feature the tupilaq eventually murdering its creator&rsquo;s spouse&nbsp;or family members due to a distant relationship to the original target that no&nbsp;one knew about.</p>
<p>Tupilaqs&rsquo; animating energies aren&rsquo;t tied to their original functions, and the&nbsp;creatures typically long outlast their creators, their victims, and often any who&nbsp;recall the reason for their creation. They might fall into a sort of hibernation once&nbsp;they&rsquo;ve achieved immediate vengeance, but they frequently reawaken to continue&nbsp;their rampage against unsuspecting targets ignorant of their involvement.</p>
<p>Spellcasters might occasionally summon these constructs. Summoned tupilaqs, hauled unceremoniously from their vengeance, become near-frenzied&nbsp;combatants, unleashing every offensive ability in their arsenal to break free.&nbsp;These reactions aren&rsquo;t strategic or considered, but an instinctual, almost&nbsp;programmed need to return to their true purpose. Conjurers should be&nbsp;wary about tupilaqs employing spells that might be turned against&nbsp;their summoners, such as a fireball spell &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; placed such&nbsp;that it incinerates the spellcaster and returns these creatures from&nbsp;whence they came.</p>
