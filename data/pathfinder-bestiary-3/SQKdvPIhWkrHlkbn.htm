------ Description (en) ------
<p>Most towns and cities on Golarion have a garrison of professional guards whose duties include patrolling the streets, assisting citizenry in need, and acting as a quick military response in times of crisis. Guards usually operate in pairs or small groups, but when a serious emergency threatens, guards muster at the nearest keep, watch station, or other rallying point and then move out in search of their quarry.Alternatively, guard troops might be stationed at important locations in the city, such as the front gates, the main prison, or the entrance to the ruler&rsquo;s castle.</p>
<p>Individual guards may not be particularly well trained or experienced, but in large numbers they can defeat bandits, wild creatures that have slipped past the city gates, or the occasional drunken ogre. A group of city guards is usually accompanied and commanded by a single captain, who does most of the talking and gives individual guards their orders. The members of this city guard squadron have trained together to perform simple tactics but not advanced maneuvers.</p>
