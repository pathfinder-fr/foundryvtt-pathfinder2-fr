------ Description (en) ------
<p>Gremlins arose long ago in the First World, living embodiments of nature&rsquo;s ability to wear away, erode, and decompose. On the Material Plane, their encounters with mortal civilizations twisted them into creatures devoted to chaos, sabotage, and traps, each variety specializing in a particular brand of mayhem.</p>

<p>Hanivers are the most benign type of gremlin&mdash;capricious fey who skim the waves on rubbery fin-wings. Though they don&rsquo;t actively sabotage their environment, sailors bemoan these gremlins&rsquo; grasping fingers. Hanivers&rsquo; incessant curiosity compels them to examine any object that draws their attention. Such treasures might include an overturned fruit basket, a sack of coins, or a shark&rsquo;s gleaming teeth (often still in the shark&rsquo;s mouth, to the fey&rsquo;s regret). Should hanivers like what they find, they steal it, making them a bane to fishers and dockworkers everywhere.</p>
