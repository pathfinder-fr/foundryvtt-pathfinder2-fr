------ Description (en) ------
<p>The Astral Plane is a planar nexus, connecting the planes of the Inner Sphere to those of the Outer Sphere, a realm of timeless silver substance charged with mental essence drawn from throughout the Great Beyond. Most creatures on the Astral Plane are visitors-predators seeking to poach from the River of Souls, psychopomps guarding against such incursions, and aeons monitoring the flow of raw quintessence through the Antipode. Yet, this plane has spawned creatures native to its strange currents and eddies, foremost of which is the family of thought-spawned creatures known as ennosites.</p>
<p>An ennosite's form physically embodies of its thought and purpose. As some ideals and goals are shared, so are certain forms.</p>
<hr />
<p>Shepherds of the Silver Sea, shulsagas patrol the Astral Plane to protect the nascent demiplanes that form there, warding off those who would usurp the demiplanes or despoil them with unwelcome philosophies. This guardianship extends to the Astral Plane as a whole, as shulsagas not only exile trespassers, but also seek out and close planar rifts. Especially egregious breaches rile these ennosites to the point of invasion, and shulsaga raiding parties often extend their attacks well beyond a portal to ensure the threat's utter destruction.</p>
<p>Though often stern and standoffish, shulsagas occasionally befriend and recruit strangers to help them repair planar wounds and track down foes of the natural order.</p>
<p>Among ennosites, shulsagas are the most inclined to adopt and nurture iotons, forming small family units. Communities work together to instill enough culture and identity for these iotons to take on permanent forms-those of adolescent shulsagas. Each shulsaga's gender reflects of their evolving identity, influenced in part by the blend of traits their communities imparted and their own thoughts.</p>
