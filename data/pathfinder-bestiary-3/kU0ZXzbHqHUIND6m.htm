Name: Fortune Eater

------ Description (en) ------
<p>The fickle finger of fate has quashed hundreds of fledgling adventurers, sometimes in a particularly memorable or ignominious manner. When a number of would-be heroes perish together in such a way, their restless spirits might arise-spurred by jealousy-to become a fortune eater. A fortune eater is a collective entity that might lurk near fortune tellers, taverns, or Pathfinder Society lodges where adventurers are likely to pass through. The spirit then follows the heroes on their quests until the right moment, when the spirit manifests their unfortunate abilities to get the party killed and potentially add them to the collective. Sometimes they linger near the lairs of a powerful monster, waiting for parties of unwary adventurers.</p>
<p>A fortune eater lingers because of unfinished business: to move on, they must help a hero defeat a great threat or acquire a legendary item. Ironically, their jealousy, rage, and powers of bad luck make this extremely unlikely.</p>
