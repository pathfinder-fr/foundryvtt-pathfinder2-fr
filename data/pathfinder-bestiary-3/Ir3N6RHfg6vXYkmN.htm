------ Description (en) ------
<p>Rams are sturdy, stubborn herd animals suited to rugged terrain and cold weather. Regardless of their territory, all share a stubborn nature and surefootedness, navigating uncertain terrain with ease and weathering all seasons in scattered herds.</p>
<hr />
<p>These hardy mountain dwellers surpass their lowlander cousins in stubbornness and agility. Rosethorn rams sport distinctive, twisted horns that measure up to 4 feet in length and bear thorny growths, which they use to damage enemies in combat and strip the bark from trees during harsh winters when other food is scarce.</p>
<p>Though hardly a domesticated species, rosethorn rams' shaggy outer coats cover fine hair that makes a yarn prized for both its softness and rarity. Their milk also provides nourishment during severe seasons.</p>
