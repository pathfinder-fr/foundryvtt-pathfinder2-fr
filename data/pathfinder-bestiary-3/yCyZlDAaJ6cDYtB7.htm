------ Description (en) ------
<p>Wollipeds are large, docile herd animals found in the snowy foothills of large&nbsp;mountains. Their eight legs give them sure footing even in icy terrain, and they&nbsp;grow thick, warm fleece as protection against the elements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arctic ranchers have been breeding wollipeds for hundreds of years, as the&nbsp;gentle creatures take well to domestication and make plentiful, hardy sources&nbsp;of meat, milk, and wool. The creatures also provide sure-footed transport in&nbsp;difficult mountain regions, and they can even be trained for plowing and hauling&nbsp;if necessary.</p>
<p>As a result of their widespread domestication, few are found in the wild.&nbsp;Young wollipeds have weak vision during their first few weeks and habitually&nbsp;follow any larger creature that walks by. Usually, these young wollipeds become&nbsp;attached their rancher or parents, but on occasion a few might follow large&nbsp;wild creatures and wander off from their herd. This has led to feral wollipeds&nbsp;around the Kodar mountains in Irrisen that are much more aggressive than their&nbsp;domesticated cousins.</p>
<p>Wollipeds are extremely sturdy, and their docile temperaments make&nbsp;them excellent mounts for those traveling mountain passes. Some mountain&nbsp;settlements have further trained their wollipeds to fight. Battle-ready wollipeds&nbsp;are formidable enemies that pose a threat to even the most experienced of&nbsp;challengers-but even untrained, wollipeds are not defenseless. In addition to their long tusks, they have developed spitting as a way of communication and&nbsp;assault, and readily regurgitate a mixture of stomach acid and the remnants of&nbsp;their last meal to deter predators.</p>
<p>Few on Golarion realize that these arctic beasts are not native to their world.&nbsp;Wollipeds originated on the planet Triaxus, a world with a magically enhanced&nbsp;eccentric orbit around the same star as Golarion. During the centuries-long&nbsp;Triaxian winters, wollipeds play an integral role in many communities as food,&nbsp;wool, transportation, and even a simple form of companionship. During the&nbsp;equally extended tropical summers, wollipeds retreat to the polar extremes of&nbsp;their world to await the return of the long snows.</p>
