------ Description (en) ------
<p>Hundreds of bloodshot eyes peek out from under the fleshy layers of a hyakume&rsquo;s skin. These hulking aberrations covet knowledge and go to great lengths to keep what they know to themselves; they&rsquo;ll destroy scriptoriums they&rsquo;ve raided and burn books they&rsquo;ve read to ensure no other soul learns their contents. While hyakume occasionally trade valuable information to garner greater knowledge, they are liable to trick their targets into revealing more than they should. Most frightening of all is the hyakume&rsquo;s ability to steal memories and erase any knowledge of their existence from the minds of their victim</p>
