Name: Baykok

------ Description (en) ------
<p>A baykok is the restless remnant of a warrior or hunter, cast out for evil acts and cursed to forever soar through the sky far from its home, unable to ever set foot on the ground again. The creature's despairing, lonely cries at night are audible for miles across the wilderness it haunts. Jealous rage drives it to hunt isolated humanoids, especially warriors and hunters who remind it of the life it once had and squandered. A baykok's invisible arrows carry its soul-freezing loneliness, and its envious touch can steal a helpless victim's vitality.</p>
