------ Description (en) ------
<p>The primal power of the world flows through you. You transform into an incarnation of nature, either a green man or a kaiju. Your battle form is Medium for a green man or Gargantuan (30-foot-by-30-foot space) for a kaiju. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. While in this form, you gain the plant trait (for a green man) or the beast trait (for a kaiju). You can Dismiss the spell.</p>
<p>You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:</p>
<ul>

<li>30 temporary Hit Points.</li>
<li>Darkvision.</li>
<li>One or more attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +34, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled} condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.</li>
