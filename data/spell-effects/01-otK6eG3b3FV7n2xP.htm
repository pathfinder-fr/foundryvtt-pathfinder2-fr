------ Description (en) ------
<p>You call upon the spirits of the soil to twist and churn, transforming the terrain in the targeted area into a sodden mess. The area becomes difficult terrain. Creatures in the area when you Cast this Spell must attempt a Reflex saving throw.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature sinks partially into the mud. The creature takes a -15-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds (except for its swim Speed, if any) and becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed}. These effects last until the creature leaves the area or until the end of its next turn, whichever comes first.</p>
