<p>Granted by @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ZL5UU9quCTvcWzfY]{Mountain Stance}</p>
<p>You enter the stance of an implacable mountain—a technique first discovered by dwarven monks—allowing you to strike with the weight of an avalanche. The only Strikes you can make are falling stone unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the&nbsp;brawling&nbsp;group; and have the&nbsp;forceful,&nbsp;nonlethal, and&nbsp;unarmed&nbsp;traits.<br /><br />While in Mountain Stance, you gain a +4 item bonus to AC and a +2 circumstance bonus to any defenses against being&nbsp;Shoved&nbsp;or&nbsp;Tripped. However, you have a Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of +0, meaning you don't add your Dexterity to your AC, and your Speeds are all reduced by 5 feet. The item bonus to AC from Mountain Stance is cumulative with&nbsp;armor potency runes&nbsp;on your&nbsp;explorer's clothing,&nbsp;mage armor, and&nbsp;bracers of armor.</p>
