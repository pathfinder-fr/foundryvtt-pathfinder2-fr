------ Description (en) ------
<p>Granted by @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.zCcfPS4y5SrZzU2x]{Plant Form}.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from verdant creatures, you transform into a Large plant battle form. You must have space to expand into or the spell is lost. You can substitute a similar specific plant to turn into (such as a pitcher plant instead of a flytrap), but this has no effect on the form's Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the plant trait. You can Dismiss the spell.</p>
<p>You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>AC = 19 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.</li>
<li>12 temporary Hit Points.</li>
<li>Resistance 10 to poison.</li>
<li>Low-light vision.</li>
<li>One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +17, and your damage bonus is +11. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled} condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.</li>
<li>Athletics modifier of +19, unless your own modifier is higher.</li>
</ul>
<p>You also gain specific abilities based on the type of plant you choose:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arboreal</strong>
<ul>
<li>Speed 30 feet; you can speak in this form, but you still can't Cast a Spell or supply verbal components.</li>
<li><strong>Melee</strong> <span class="pf2-icon">1</span> branch (reach 15 feet), <strong>Damage</strong> 2d10 bludgeoning;</li>
<li><strong>Melee</strong> <span class="pf2-icon">1</span> foot, <strong>Damage</strong> 2d8 bludgeoning</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> Your battle form is Huge, and the reach of your attacks increases by 5 feet. You instead gain AC = 22 + your level, 24 temporary HP, attack modifier +21, damage bonus +16, and Athletics +22.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Note: To heighten this effect, import it into your Item Directory and edit the level before adding it to the target</em></p>
