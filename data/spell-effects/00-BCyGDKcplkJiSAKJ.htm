------ Description (en) ------
<p>Granted by @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.7FRYyKXDKjGoANYj]{Stumbling Stance}</p>
<p>You enter a seemingly unfocused stance that mimics the movements of the inebriated—bobbing, weaving, leaving false openings, and distracting your enemies from your true movements. While in this stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.QNAVeNKtHA0EUw4X]{Feint}.</p>
<p>The only Strikes you can make are stumbling swing unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. If an enemy hits you with a melee Strike while in this stance, it becomes flat-footed against the next stumbling swing Strike you make against it before the end of your next turn.</p>
