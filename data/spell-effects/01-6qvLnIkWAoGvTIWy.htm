------ Description (en) ------
<p>The public work refuses to repair itself, and the memories of the community members are soured in response to the botched ritual. For the next week, while a caster is within 60 feet of the site of the ritual, they cannot receive any benefit from beneficial emotion effects, and they take a -10-foot status penalty to their Speeds as their movement slows to a morose crawl.</p>
