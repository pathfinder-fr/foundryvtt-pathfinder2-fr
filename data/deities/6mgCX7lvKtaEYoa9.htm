------ Description (en) ------
<p>The dwarven gods are one large family, with @Compendium[pf2e.deities.sZrdzh0ANQnZGXJb]{Torag} as its patriarch. He is joined by his brothers @Compendium[pf2e.deities.nsiDGdgbAzkTQzOt]{Magrim} (the Taskmaster) and @Compendium[pf2e.deities.Xb1N5YfxboJH26Jh]{Angradd} (the Forge Fire), his half-sister @Compendium[pf2e.deities.oyp2E685VsQFKMXi]{Dranngvit} (the Debt Minder), and his wife @Compendium[pf2e.deities.VEyowuhC4FsBnG8c]{Folgrit} (the Watchful Mother). His children are @Compendium[pf2e.deities.HD7g8T8ioy1EH3M8]{Bolka} (the Golden Gift), @Compendium[pf2e.deities.tk7gRxXsqvBwQrUF]{Grundinnar} (the Peacemaker), @Compendium[pf2e.deities.zhPhYge7VJbIlJvA]{Kols} (the Oath-Keeper), and @Compendium[pf2e.deities.N8a76dkGfUvxvSW0]{Trudd} (the Mighty). Torag's evil former student @Compendium[pf2e.deities.39z55kowQFOUH2v0]{Droskar} (the Dark Smith), though technically part of the dwarven pantheon, is rarely invoked by any save duergars.</p>
