<p>The traditional deities of the elven pantheon are @Compendium[pf2e.deities.AlL9GtlTldbqNoVm]{Calistria}, @Compendium[pf2e.deities.JgqH3BhuEuA4Zyqs]{Desna}, @Compendium[pf2e.deities.liXIbl7y8www2eAn]{Findeladlara} (goddess of twilight and traditional art and architecture), @Compendium[pf2e.deities.wjXNXFWBLbJaeZQR]{Ketephys} (god of hunting and the moon), and @Compendium[pf2e.deities.uYpxTi4byHc5w78R]{Yuelral} (goddess of gems, craft, and magic). Elves have also adopted @Compendium[pf2e.deities.9n2CI0B3EA4y3BuU]{Alseta}, a minor goddess of doors and transitions, as their patron of teleportation and aiudara (commonly known as elf gates). Most elves value magic, beauty, freedom, and friendship as part of a fulfilling life and tend to worship all of the deities together as exemplars of these values. Alongside full-blooded elves, many half-elves-whether raised by elves or seeking a closer connection to their elven heritage- worship the elven pantheon.</p>
