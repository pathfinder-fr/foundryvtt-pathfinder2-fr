------ Description (en) ------
<p>The serpentfolk god is not dead, but in his decapitated state, he might as well be. Reduced to a feral, animalistic existence, Ydersius is even less aware of his legacy than the lowest of the aapoph. Ydersius's symbol is a snake's skull surrounded by a skeletal ouroboros.</p>
<p><strong>Edicts</strong> seek to return Ydersius to life, fulfill your passions, conquer your foes with no mercy, achieve glory for serpentkind</p>
<p><strong>Anathema</strong> put the needs of others above those of serpentfolk, aid the spawn of Azlant</p>
