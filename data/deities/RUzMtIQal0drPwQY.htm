------ Description (en) ------
<p>Gogunta, Song of the Swamp, is the demon lord of amphibians, boggards, and swamps. Gogunta is worshipped as a goddess by boggards, who believe her to be an ascended mobogo, though scholars suspect she was a former hezrou who gained the favor of Dagon. Lending credence to this latter theory, her realm, a stinking salt marsh, is located within Dagon's oceanic realm. Gogunta appears as an enormous, multi-headed frog with dozens of eyes and even more tongues, though boggards typically depict her as a titanic boggard queen.</p>
