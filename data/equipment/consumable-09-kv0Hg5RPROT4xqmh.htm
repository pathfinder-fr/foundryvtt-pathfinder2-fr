<hr />
<p><em>Silencing ammunition</em> is particularly dense and seems to dampen sounds around it. On a successful Strike, an activated piece of <em>silencing ammunition</em> creates a 2nd-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gIdDLrbswTV3OBJy]{Silence}</em> effect on the target. The target can resist the effects of the ammunition with a successful <span data-pf2-check="will" data-pf2-traits="consumable,illusion,magical" data-pf2-label="Remove or Resist Silence Effect DC" data-pf2-dc="25" data-pf2-show-dc="gm">Will</span> save, though it takes a -2 circumstance penalty if the Strike was a critical hit. While the effect is active, the target can use an Interact action to try to tug out the arrow or bolt and end the effect early; this requires a successful DC 25 Will save.</p>
