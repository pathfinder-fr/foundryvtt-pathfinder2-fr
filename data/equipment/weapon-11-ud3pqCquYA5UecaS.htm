------ Description (en) ------
<p>This stone-headed +2 striking returning javelin draws forth the power of the earth itself to strike at enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span style="font-family: 'Pathfinder2eActions'; font-size: 1.8em; display: inline;">A</span> Interact</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> You hurl the <em>stoneraiser javelin</em> at an unoccupied space within 30 feet.</p>
<p>The javelin's power flows into the ground, which erupts in a 5-foot-radius burst of razor-sharp stalagmites. The stalagmites are 10 feet tall.</p>
<p>Everything on each side of the stalagmites has cover from creatures on the opposite side, and the stalagmites' spaces are difficult terrain. A creature takes [[/r 4d4]] piercing damage for every move action it takes that enters at least one of the affected spaces.</p>
<p>Each 5-foot-by-5-foot section has AC 10, Hardness 14, and 30 Hit Points. It's immune to critical hits and precision damage. A destroyed section can be moved through freely. The stalagmites crumble to dust after 1 minute.</p>
<p>Any creature in the area when the stalagmites appear is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space of its choice; this movement is forced movement. Pushed creatures must attempt a DC 28 Reflex saving throw or take [[/r 4d4]] piercing damage.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.<br /><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes half damage.<br /><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes full damage.<br /><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature takes double damage and is knocked prone.</p>
