The javelin’s power flows into the ground, which erupts in a 5-foot-radius burst of razor-sharp stalagmites. The stalagmites are 10 feet tall. Everything on each side of the stalagmites has cover from creatures on the opposite side, and the stalagmites’ spaces are difficult terrain. A creature takes 4d4 piercing damage for every move action it takes that enters at least one of the affected spaces. Each 5-foot-by-5-foot section has AC 10, Hardness 14, and 30 Hit Points. It’s immune to critical hits and precision damage. A destroyed section can be moved through freely. The stalagmites crumble to dust after 1 minute. <br></span></p>
