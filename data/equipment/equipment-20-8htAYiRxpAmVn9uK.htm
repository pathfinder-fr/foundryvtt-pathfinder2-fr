<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class="pf2-icon">3</span> command;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> You attempt to make the ring cast an arcane @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]{Wish} spell. However, if the ring doesn't deem the wish to be sufficiently selfless, the wish isn't cast and the ring can't be activated for 24 hours.</p>
<p>You are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 3}, whether or not the ring refuses the wish.</p>
<hr />
<p>Once the wish is cast, the Ring of Recalcitrant Wishes has no powers, though it is rumored that the wearer's death in an act of profound self-sacrifice restores the wish to the ring.</p>
