------ Description (en) ------
<p>This shining prism is bound within a golden frame. The bright glow within the artifact is the gleaming essence of celestials bound within it in ancient times. Each activation consumes a bit of this celestial energy, projecting the screams of the celestials into your mind.</p>
<p>While holding the Radiant Spark, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against divine spells and effects and you are aware of its powers.</p>
<p>If you are good, while holding the Radiant Spark, you are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 3} and can't recover from this condition.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class="pf2-icon">2</span> envision, Interact;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The Radiant Spark casts a 10th-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.OsOhx3TGIZ7AhD0P]{Dominate} spell (<span data-pf2-saving-throw="will" data-pf2-traits="enchantment,incapacitation,mental" data-pf2-label="Dominate DC" data-pf2-dc="49" data-pf2-show-dc="gm">Will</span>) on a creature that isn't from the Material Plane. Celestials get an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of their save.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class="pf2-icon">f</span> envision;</p>
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You begin casting a @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.2ykmAVKrsAWcazcC]{Planar Binding} ritual;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The Radiant Spark reduces the casting time of the ritual to 1 hour, and you don't need secondary casters for this ritual.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class="pf2-icon">r</span> envision, Interact;</p>
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> The target critically fails their save against the Radiant Spark's dominate spell or you critically succeed at binding the target with the planar binding ritual using the artifact;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The target must attempt a <span data-pf2-saving-throw="will" data-pf2-traits="conjuration,occult" data-pf2-label="Radiant Spark DC" data-pf2-dc="49" data-pf2-show-dc="gm">Will</span> save and is immune to further attempts for 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 2}.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target dies and its essence is trapped within the Radiant Spark. It can be brought back to life only with powerful magic such as @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]{Wish} or @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.YfJTXyVGzLhM6V8U]{Miracle}.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, and the target can't be brought back to life until the Radiant Spark is destroyed.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Destruction</strong> An archfiend or evil demigod must willingly swap their essence with that of a celestial dominated or bound by the artifact, then critically fail the saving throw against having their essence consumed. This permanently destroys both the artifact and the fiend or demigod.</p>
