------ Description (en) ------
<p>You can pull a dueling cape you're wearing from your shoulder and wrap it around your arm with an @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F]{Interact} action.</p>
<p>While wielding the dueling cape this way, the cape uses that arm and hand, and you can't hold anything else in that hand.</p>
<p>While you do so, you can spend an action to hold it in a protective position, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and to Deception checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.QNAVeNKtHA0EUw4X]{Feint} until the start of your next turn.</p>
