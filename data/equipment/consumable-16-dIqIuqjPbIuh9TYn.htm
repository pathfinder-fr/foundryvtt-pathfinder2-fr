<p>This length of silver chain has a tiger's fang on one end and the tip of a dire boar's tusk on the other. When you activate the chain, an ephemeral chain encircles the target creature's head and a cacophony of animal sounds clouds its mind. It must attempt a <span data-pf2-saving-throw="will" data-pf2-traits="" data-pf2-label="Tusk and Fang Chain DC" data-pf2-dc="35" data-pf2-show-dc="owner">Will</span> save.</p>

<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is confused for 1 minute and the creature doesn't receive a flat check to end its confusion if it takes damage. At the end of each of its turns, it attempts a new Will save, ending the effect on a success.</p>
