<p>Though expensive, these single-use alchemical bombs are often used by police forces to disperse unruly crowds and quell riots without risking permanent physical injury to either officers or civilians.</p>
<p>The bomb can be thrown up to 30 feet, causing it to explode, spraying the aerosolized pepper dust in a 15-foot-radius burst. All creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex save to avoid inhaling the dust or getting it in their eyes.</p>
<p>On a failed save, the creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} for 1 round and then @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} for 1 round.</p>
<p>On a critical failure, the creature is blinded for 1 round, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened} 1, and dazzled until it removes the sickened condition.</p>
