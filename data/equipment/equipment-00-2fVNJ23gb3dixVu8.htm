------ Description (en) ------
<p>This canvas vest has been filled with cork shavings, tightly folded, and sewn shut. Wearing a buoyancy vest allows you to float in water with a lowered risk of sinking. If you end your turn in water while wearing a buoyancy vest and haven’t succeeded at a Swim action that turn, attempt a DC 5 flat check.</p>
<p>On a success, you do not sink, though you can still get moved by the current, as determined by the GM. The GM can also determine whether the vest&nbsp;is more or less effective in different weather conditions, raising the DC in rough waters or lowering the DC in calm water.</p>
