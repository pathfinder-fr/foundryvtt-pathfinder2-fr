------ Description (en) ------
<p>A <em>bloodbane</em> clan dagger is especially vicious against the ancestral enemies of the clan. When you damage an appropriate type of creature with the weapon, that creature takes [[/r 1d4]] persistent bleed damage. The type of creature depends on the clan that made the dagger, but is typically drow, duergar, giant, or orc.</p>
<p>In addition, whenever you inflict persistent bleed damage with a <em>bloodbane</em> weapon (whether from its innate ability or in some other way), the weapon leaves ragged wounds. The bleeding creature must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or become sickened 1. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.</p>
