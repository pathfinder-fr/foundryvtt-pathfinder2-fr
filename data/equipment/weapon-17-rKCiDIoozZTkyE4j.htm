<p><strong>Effect</strong> You cause one of the tentacles forming the weapon's five barrels to stretch out and attempt to pull and grab a creature within 15 feet. The tentacle attempts to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.PMbdMWc2QroouFGD]{Grapple} with a [[/r 1d20+27 #grapple check]]{+27} bonus. It can attempt to Grapple any creature, regardless of size. On a success, the tentacle pulls the creature up to 10 feet directly towards you, until it's in a square adjacent to you.</p>
