------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">This flat piece of hard stone is specially prepared for etching a magical fundamental rune or property rune. You can etch only one rune upon a stone. Once the stone is etched, it gains the magic school trait of the rune etched upon it. When a rune is transferred from the <em>runestone</em> to another object, the <em>runestone</em> cracks and is destroyed. The Price listed is for an empty stone; a stone holding a rune adds the Price of the rune.&nbsp;</span></p>
