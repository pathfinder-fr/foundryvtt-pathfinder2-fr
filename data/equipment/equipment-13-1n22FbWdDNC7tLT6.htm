------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput"><em>Rock-braced</em> armor makes you as hard to move as a boulder. Whenever another creature attempts to forcibly move you from your space, you gain a +4 item bonus to your Fortitude DC against the check to move you. If the creature would not normally need to attempt a check to move you, then the creature must succeed at an Athletics check against your Fortitude DC (including the +4 item bonus) or you are unmoved.&nbsp;</span></p>
