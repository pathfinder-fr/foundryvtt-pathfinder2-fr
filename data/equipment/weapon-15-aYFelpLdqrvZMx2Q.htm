------ Description (en) ------
<p>This <em>+2 greater striking composite shortbow</em> is made from wood, horn, and sinew. Once wielded by Ninshaburian heretics, it's carried in a leather case etched with images of Namzaruum in combat with Somnalu. On a successful Strike, it deals an additional [[/r {1d6}[bludgeoning]]]{1d6 bludgeoning damage}.</p>

<p><strong>Effect</strong> You make a ranged Strike. On a hit, a vortex of air trails the arrow as it travels. When the arrow strikes its target, the vortex expands to a @Template[type:burst|distance:30]{30-foot radius} from its point of impact. The arrow deals an additional [[/r {1d8}[bludgeoning]]]{1d8 bludgeoning damage} against its target. For the next 3 minutes, any physical ranged attacks that would strike a target within the vortex deal an additional [[/r {1d8}[bludgeoning]]]{1d8 bludgeoning damage}. The vortex is difficult terrain, and creatures attempting to fly through the vortex using a move action must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:34|traits:evocation,magical|showDC:owner] save, losing its move action on a failed save. Any gases within the vortex are cleared by the winds.</p>
