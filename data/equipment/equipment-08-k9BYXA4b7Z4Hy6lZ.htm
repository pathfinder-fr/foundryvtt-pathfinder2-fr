<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Symbols of musical notes decorate this gold-framed wooden cube measuring just under 1 foot by 1 foot. A funnel-shaped trumpet protrudes from the box's top at an angle, though it feels surprisingly light. The box has a large button on its side, and it must be set down on a flat surface in order to activate it; while it's activated, the rumbling and churning gears inside the box make it impossible to carry without dropping it.<br><br><strong>Activate</strong>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Pathfinder2eActions'; font-size: 1.8em; display: inline;">A</span> Interact; <strong>Effect</strong> You press the button on the side of the music box, causing it to erupt with a cacophonous and discordant melody for 1 minute while it plays its entire melody, and it can't be shut off prematurely. The music is so loud that any creature within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.9PR9y0bi4JPKnHPR]{Deafened} for as long as they remain within 60 feet of the music box, and for 1 minute thereafter. On a critical success, a creature need not make any more saves and is temporarily immune to the <em>deafening music box</em> for the next 24 hours; on a success, the creature must attempt a new save each round it remains within 60 feet of the music box.</span></p>
