------ Description (en) ------
<p>A drake rifle is a firearm made from the saliva glands of a drake. The firearm launches small bursts of empowered spittle instead of typical rounds of ammunition. A drake rifle is a +1 weapon. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals 1d10 acid damage with a range increment of 150 feet and reload 1. On a critical hit, the spittle clings to the target and they take persistent damage of the same type as the weapon equal to [[/r {1d4+1+@item.runes.striking}[persistent,cold]]]{1d4 + the number of weapon damage dice}. A drake rifle does not add critical specialization effects.</p>
