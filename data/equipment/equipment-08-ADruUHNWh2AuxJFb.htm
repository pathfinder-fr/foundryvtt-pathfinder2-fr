------ Description (en) ------
<p>This set of hinged metal plates features studs on the inside of each plate to provide a texture for the pastry cakes you cook with it. You pour batter on the plates, close the device, and place it on a fire or stove to cook.</p>
<p>The plates of this waffle iron are made of standard-grade mithral rather than iron and might bear an imprint on the plates. As with other mithral cookware, food rarely sticks to a mithral waffle iron. As it's made of mithral, this is an uncommon item.</p>
