------ Description (en) ------
<p>This set of reflective metal wires takes 10 minutes to properly tie along the wrist’s energy meridians, then repels attempts at mental manipulation. You gain a +2 item bonus to your next save against a mental effect after tying on the bracelet. After this save, the metal strands tarnish and fall off (possibly alerting the wearer or others that their mind has been tampered with).</p>
<p>You can remove the bracelet with an Interact action, but doing so breaks the bracelet’s alignment and requires you to spend another 10 minutes to carefully tie it back on.</p>
