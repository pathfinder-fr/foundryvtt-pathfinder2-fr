<p><strong>Activate</strong> (Free Actio) Interact; <strong>Trigger</strong> You critically fail a saving throw or are critically hit by an attack</p>
<hr>
<p>This strand of hair shimmers like the strands of fate. When you activate the string, it resonates with a single, perfect note. The triggering saving throw becomes a failure or the triggering attack roll becomes a regular hit, not critical one. If the source of the attack or effect is an evil creature, that creature must succeed at a DC 41 Will saving throw or be enfeebled 2 and stupefied 2 until the end of its next turn.</p>
