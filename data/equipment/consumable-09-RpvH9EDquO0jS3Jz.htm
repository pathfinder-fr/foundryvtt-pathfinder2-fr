<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">The head of this arrow is made from gleaming copper. When an activated <em>storm arrow</em> hits a target, it is buffeted by raging winds and struck by a bolt of lightning that deals 3d12 electricity damage and the target must attempt a DC 25 Reflex saving throw. If this arrow is shot from a weapon with a shock&nbsp;property rune, the save DC increases to 27, though the attack doesn’t benefit from the <em>shock</em> property rune itself.<br></span></p>
