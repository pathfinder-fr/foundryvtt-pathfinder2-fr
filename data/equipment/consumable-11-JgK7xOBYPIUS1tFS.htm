------ Description (en) ------
You gain inner serenity, focused on fine details and steeled against mental assaults, but you find violence off-putting. The bonus is +3, or +4 vs. mental, and the duration is 1 hour. When you roll a success on a Will save against a mental effect, you get a critical success instead.
