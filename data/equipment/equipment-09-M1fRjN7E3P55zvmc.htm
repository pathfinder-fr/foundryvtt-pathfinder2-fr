------ Description (en) ------
<p>An <em>inspiring spotlight</em> is a bulky contraption consisting of a drum-shaped metal housing around several reflective metal plates. Two handles on either side, each with a small button, allow you to aim the spotlight outward from your body.</p>
<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span style="font-family: 'Pathfinder2eActions'; font-size: 1.8em; display: inline;">A</span> Interact</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> Once per hour</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> When you push the left-hand button, the <em>inspiring spotlight</em> emits a beam of bright magical light in a 120-foot line that hangs in the air and remains in place even if you move the spotlight. If the line passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, the <em>inspiring spotlight</em> attempts to counteract the darkness.</p>
<p>Creatures within the line gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, creatures in the line who are frightened reduce the value of their frightened condition by 1 at the beginning of each turn they start in the area of the line.</p>
<p>The beam remains in place for 1 minute or until you push the right-hand button with another Interact action to extinguish the light.</p>
