<p>This thin leather cord bears delicate runic markings and threads through an item that can bear affixed talismans.</p>
<p>When you Affix a Talisman to that item, you can thread the talisman onto the cord, activating the cord’s preserving effects. The cord is attuned to three particular schools of magic, chosen when the cord was created. It gains the corresponding trait for that school. When you activate a talisman threaded through a cord with the same magic school trait that’s also the cord’s level or lower, attempt a DC 16 flat check. On a success, that talisman is not consumed and can be used again.</p>
