<p>Favored by caravan guards who traverse the Mana Wastes, a piercing wind is similar to a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.NEZfXSasFdLdQFBi]{Jezail}, in that you can carry it in one hand as long as the other hand's free, by holding it under one arm. Additionally, it's fitted with an underslung curved blade.</p>
