------ Description (en) ------
<p>Some mutants savor the acrid smog of Alkenstar and the Gunworks. A <em>smogger</em> recreates this pollution by sucking in clean air and spewing it back out as pungent smog.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class="pf2-icon">2</span> (poison) Interact</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>smogger</em> creates a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10]{10-foot-radius emanation} of smog centered on you, which moves with you. You and other creatures in the smog are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} while inside the smog, and other creatures are concealed to you and other creatures in the smog. A strong wind doesn't disperse the smog but reduces it to a 5-foot- radius emanation. A creature that must breathe that begins its turn inside of the smog can choose to hold its breath as a free action for the round, but if it doesn't, it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1}. The <em>smogger</em> can maintain this effect for up to 1 minute, and the wearer of the <em>smogger</em> can Dismiss the effect.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class="pf2-icon">2</span> (poison) Interact</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The <em>smogger's</em> above activation is in effect</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The smog created by the <em>smogger</em> thickens into a toxic element that burns the eyes, blisters flesh, and causes fits of coughing. All creatures in the smog cloud, including you, must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:32] save—creatures that must breathe and aren't holding their breath take a -2 circumstance penalty to this save.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is sickened 1.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is sickened 1 (or increases their sickened condition value to 2 if it isn't holding its breath). The creature also takes [[/r {4d6}[poison]]]{4d6 poison damage}.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature takes [[/r {8d6}[poison]]]{8d6 poison damage}.</p>
