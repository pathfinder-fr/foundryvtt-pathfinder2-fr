<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class="pf2-icon">r</span> command;</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour;</p>
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You successfully Strike with the flail while activating its extending rune;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The head of the flail wraps around the target of the triggering Strike and drags it in your direction. The target must succeed at a <span data-pf2-check="fortitude" data-pf2-traits="magical,transmutation" data-pf2-label="Ouroboros Flail Pull DC" data-pf2-dc="37" data-pf2-show-dc="gm">Fortitude</span> save or be pulled adjacent to you. A creature pulled in is then @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} by the flail until the end of your next turn unless you move, your target Escapes (DC 37), or you use the flail.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class="pf2-icon">3</span> Interact;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> You extend the flail's chain, then wrap it across itself and strike two links together. This severs a usable 120-foot loop of chain from the flail, which instantly returns to its normal length. If you use this activation again, any previous chain you created with it disappears after 1 round. As with most obviously magical and temporary constructs, the chain cannot be sold.</p>
