------ Description (en) ------
<p>Maps are uncommon. Most maps you can find are simple and functional. A survey map details a single location in excellent detail.</p>
<p>One of these maps gives you a +1 item bonus to Survival checks and any skill checks to Recall Knowledge, provided the checks are related to the location detailed on the map.</p>
<p>Maps sometimes come in atlases, containing a number of maps of the same quality, often on similar topics. An atlas costs five times as much as a single map and requires both hands to use.</p>
<p>The GM determines what maps are available in any location.</p>
