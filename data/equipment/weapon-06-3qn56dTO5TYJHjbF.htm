------ Description (en) ------
<p>Built from the spiked tail of a manticore, a <em>spike launcher</em> is designed to launch large, spear-like projectiles. A <em>spike launcher</em> is a <em>+1 striking</em> weapon. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals [[/r {1d8}[piercing]]]{1d8 piercing damage}. It has the backstabber, fatal aim d12, and kickback traits with a range increment of 120 feet and reload 2. It uses the critical specialization of the bow weapon group, rather than the firearm critical specialization.</p>

<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>spike launcher</em> fires a volley of smaller spikes in a @Template[type:burst|distance:10] centered anywhere within its range. Make a Strike with the <em>spike launcher</em> against each creature in the area. On a success, the spike causes the creature to take a -5-foot status penalty to their Speed. On a critical success, the creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} instead. In either case, the creature, or an adjacent creature, can use an Interact action to remove the spike and end the penalty or immobilized condition.</p>
