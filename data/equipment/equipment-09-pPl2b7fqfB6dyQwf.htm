------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">This tiny box holds a fragment of religious scripture sacred to a particular deity. The box is worn by affixing it to a leather cord and tying it around your head just above your brow. You don&rsquo;t gain any benefit from the phylactery if you don&rsquo;t worship the affiliated deity. The phylactery grants you religious wisdom, which manifests as a +2 item bonus to Religion checks. Just before you perform an action that would be anathema to the phylactery&rsquo;s deity, the phylactery warns you of the potential transgression in time for you to change your mind.<br /></span></p>
