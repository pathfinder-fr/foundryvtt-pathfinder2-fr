<hr />
<p>Via some strange alchemical reaction with the gasses of Terwa Lake, the cloud dragon Ixamè's eyeballs have shriveled into sky-blue gems. The dragon's sense of vision isn't impaired, and her eyes can't be removed from her head until she's destroyed. Once removed, each gem functions as a special talisman.</p>
<p><em>Ixamè's eye</em> sparkles when it's in an area of fog or mist. Activating the talisman enables you to see clearly through fog and mist for 1 minute; any creature concealed only by fog or mist is no longer concealed to you. If such a creature was relying on the concealment to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.XMcnh4cSI32tljXa]{Hide} or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VMozDqMMuK5kpoX4]{Sneak}, this also means it's no longer hidden or undetected.</p>
