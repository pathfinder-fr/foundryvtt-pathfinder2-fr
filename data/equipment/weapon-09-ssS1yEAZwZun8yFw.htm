------ Description (en) ------
<p>A <em>growth gun</em> is a <em>+1 striking hand cannon</em> made from the regenerative flesh of a hydra, troll, or other similar creature. It has an attached flesh sac that slowly replenishes one shot each round and can be loaded like a normal round of ammunition. It fires regenerating gobbets of flesh, bone, or teeth, determined by the damage type selected for its modular trait. A <em>growth gun</em> can be fired underwater, though it's still limited by the selected damage type as normal.</p>
