<hr />
<p>You’ve bargained with an imp, one of the least powerful devils, for a fragment of infernal luck.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong> Once per day, you can roll a saving throw twice and use the higher result.</p>
<p><strong>Payment</strong> At the termination of your mortal life, your soul must serve the imp for 100 years.</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Condition</strong> The “termination of mortal life” clause is carefully worded to hasten your demise. You can’t use the benefit against a death effect, and if you roll a failure on a saving throw against a death effect, you get a critical failure instead.</p>
<p><strong>Termination Clause</strong> If you critically fail a saving throw against a death effect and do not die, the contract becomes unenforceable on its terms and is voided.</p>
