------ Description (en) ------
<p>Originally developed as a body modification by oreads, <em>fleshgems</em> are crystals that can be implanted in the skin of a creature of any ancestry. While a <em>fleshgem</em> can be applied anywhere on the body for cosmetic purposes, the most common usage among adventurers is to implant them at the base of the fingers, to be used like brass knuckles.</p>
<p>You siphon your <em>fleshgem's</em> power, and the earth around you erupts in crystal stalagmites.</p>
