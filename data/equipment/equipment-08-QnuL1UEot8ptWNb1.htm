------ Description (en) ------
<p>This lockpick houses a small compartment containing many smaller picks and other miniature tools. The lockpick itself is surprisingly malleable, belying the components within. An almost-impossible number of other tools are hidden in the compartment, including an entire set of @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.6nrCxNQFycUVFOV2]{Infiltrator Thieves' Tools} and any @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.BznmPaRjI4Orb0IH]{Replacement Picks (Infiltrator Picks)}, an @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.YhkomhtKBK3i9C7Q]{Elite Disguise Kit} and any @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.IRqbsE8MgGLTfHLz]{Replacement Cosmetics (Elite)}, and an @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.TWv2EeDJaCjtmGUN]{Extreme Climber's Kit}, all while still somehow remaining only light Bulk. This makes the encompassing lockpick a favorite discreet option for rogues infiltrating high society events, as formal wear generally has few pockets and only allows a character to wear a single tool kit of light Bulk.</p>
