<p>This thin, black liquid imparts a bone-deep chill while rapidly repairing an undead creature's physical or spiritual form. When you dash oil of unlife onto an undead creature, or a living creature with negative healing, the oil absorbs quickly into its body, and the creature regains 1d8 Hit Points. You can pour oil of unlife on an incorporeal undead; in this case, the creature absorbs the oil into itself.</p>
