------ Description (en) ------
<p>This device replaces the attached firearm's normal firing mechanism (normally, most guns use a flintlock or matchlock firing mechanism). When the firearm's wielder fires the weapon, a small rune etched on a piece of stone affixed inside the mechanism releases a magical spark that's propelled through the firing mechanism and into the firearm, launching its bullet. An <em>underwater firing mechanism</em> allows the attached firearm to be fired underwater or in other conditions that would normally prevent the ignition of black powder. Attaching an <em>underwater firing mechanism</em> to a firearm takes 1 hour, though this time can overlap with the standard time required to maintain and clean your firearm to prevent misfires.</p>
