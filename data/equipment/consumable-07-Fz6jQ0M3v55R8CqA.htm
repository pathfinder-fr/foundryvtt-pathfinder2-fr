<hr />
<p>A big rock bullet is a sling bullet made of heavy granite, but each piece of ammunition feels much more dense than it appears. When activated, a big rock bullet transforms into a giant rock just before hitting the target. The target takes [[/r {12d6}[bludgeoning]]]{12d6 additional bludgeoning damage} on a successful hit. Even on a failed attack roll (but not a critical failure), the target takes [[/r {6d6}[bludgeoning]]]{6d6 bludgeoning damage}. Creatures with the @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.uG0Z8PsyZtsYuvGR]{Catch Rock} reaction can use it against a big rock bullet.</p>
