While your eidolon wears a collar of the eternal bond, the collar bolsters their connection to you, allowing them to move up to 150 feet from you before unmanifesting instead of 100 feet. The eidolon can also Activate the collar to move even further.</p>

When the duration ends, if your eidolon is more than 150 feet from you, they immediately unmanifest.</p>
