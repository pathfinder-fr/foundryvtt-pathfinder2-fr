<p>Your eyes transform into those of a giant dragonfly, the thousands of separate facets wrapping around your head, and a pair of long, delicate, insectile wings grow from your upper back. You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed.</p>
<p>Additionally, you gain @Compendium[pf2e.ancestryfeatures.DRtaqOHXTRtGRIUT]{Low-Light Vision} and a +2 item bonus to visual Perception checks, and you can't be flanked except by creatures higher level than you are (though lower‑level creatures can still help their higher‑level allies flank). These effects last for 1 minute.</p>
