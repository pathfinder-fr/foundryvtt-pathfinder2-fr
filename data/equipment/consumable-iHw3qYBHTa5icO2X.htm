------ Description (en) ------
When created, this mutagen is attuned to your choice of one of four energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. When consumed, the mutagen suffuses your body with energy that spills out of you whenever you attack. At higher levels, it can even grant you the ability to unleash the energy in controlled bursts. You gain resistance 5, add 1 point of damage on a hit with a melee weapon, and the duration is 1 minute.
