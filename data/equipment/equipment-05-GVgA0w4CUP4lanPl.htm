------ Description (en) ------
<p>The creator of the original <em>thunder helm</em> tried and failed time and again to craft a reliable, helmet-mounted firearm that enabled hands-free gunplay, but even after resorting to magical enhancements, they were never quite able to realize their vision. The allure of the <em>thunder helm</em> continues to compel certain mindsets in the Mana Wastes, and these items continue to be crafted to this day.</p>
<p>A <em>thunder helm</em> appears as a cylindrical iron helmet adorned with a crown-like display of gun barrels extending out in all directions. A slit in the front allows for limited visibility, while sound is muffled by the inner lining. As long as a creature wears a <em>thunder helm</em>, it takes a -1 circumstance penalty to auditory and visual Perception checks but also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against auditory and visual effects.</p>

<p><strong>Effect</strong> The helm's gun barrels swivel and aim randomly, then conjure enough gunpowder and bullets to fire in all directions around you. Every creature within a @Template[type:emanation|distance:20] takes [[/r {4d6}[piercing]]]{4d6 piercing damage} (@Check[type:reflex|dc:19|basic:true]). When determining a creature's resistance or immunity to this damage, use the weaker of the target's resistance or immunity to piercing or bludgeoning.</p>
