------ Description (en) ------
<p>You need thieves' tools to Pick Locks or Disable Devices (of some types) using the Thievery skill. Infiltrator thieves' tools add a +1 item bonus to checks to Pick Locks and Disable Devices.</p>
<p>Smaller and made of stronger materials than most sets of thieves' tools, the items in this kit are much easier to conceal. You gain a +1 item bonus to Stealth checks to Conceal these tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your thieves' tools are broken, you can repair them by replacing the lock picks with @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.TxMFNfkoccirCitP]{Replacement Picks} appropriate to your tools; this doesn't require using the Repair action.</p>
