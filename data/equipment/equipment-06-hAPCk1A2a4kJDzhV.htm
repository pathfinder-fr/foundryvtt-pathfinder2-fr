------ Description (en) ------
<p>The opal set in this intricately carved ivory ring eventually becomes translucent and tickles your finger whenever an incorporeal creature is nearby. When in the presence of a nearby incorporeal creature, even if it's within a solid object, you eventually detect the creature, though you might not do so instantly, and you can't pinpoint the location. This acts as a vague sense, similar to humans' sense of smell. An incorporeal creature trying to hide its presence from this sense attempts a Stealth check against your Perception DC to hide from your vague sense, as normal for attempting to foil special senses. You gain a +2 item bonus when using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} action to find @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected} incorporeal creatures within 30 feet of you.</p>
