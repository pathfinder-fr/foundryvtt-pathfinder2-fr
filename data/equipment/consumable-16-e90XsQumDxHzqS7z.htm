<hr />
<p>This plain wooden bead dangles from a string attached to the stock of the affixed weapon. When you activate the bead, its magic greatly lessens the effect of distance on your triggering attack.</p>
<p>You take no range increment penalty on your attack, even if the target is all the way out to the weapon's sixth range increment. As normal, you still can't hit a target more than six range increments away.</p>
