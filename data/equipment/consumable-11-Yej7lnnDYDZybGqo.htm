<p>You gain inner serenity, focused on file details and steeled against mental assaults, but you find violence off-putting.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong> You gain a +3 item bonus to Will saves and Perception, Medicine, Nature, Religion, and Survival checks. This bonus improves to +4 when you attempt Will saves against mental effects. When you roll a success on a Will save against a mental effect, you get a critical success instead.</p>
<p><strong>Drawback</strong> You take a -1 penalty to attack rolls and save DCs of offensive spells, and a -1 penalty per damage die to all weapon, unarmed attack, and spell damage.</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 hour.</p>
