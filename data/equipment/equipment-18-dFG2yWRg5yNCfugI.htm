------ Description (en) ------
<p>This deep red cloak fits lightly about your shoulders, and the edges perpetually twitch slightly, as though caught in a breeze. The cloth feels smoother than silk, rippling and swaying like liquid when in motion. You feel a lively energy infusing your arms and legs. You gain a +3 item bonus to Acrobatics and Stealth, and a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against attacks from reactions triggered by your movement.</p>
<p>When you invest the cloak, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.</p>
