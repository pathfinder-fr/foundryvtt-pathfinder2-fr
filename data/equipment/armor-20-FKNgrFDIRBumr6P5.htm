------ Description (en) ------
<p>This <em>+3 greater resilient greater fortification breastplate</em> absorbs impacts for later release. While wearing the armor, you gain resistance 5 to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and resistance 10 to force damage. Keep track of how much damage the armor prevents from enemy attacks, as the armor absorbs that damage.</p>
<p>After 1 minute, the absorbed damage disperses harmlessly and resets to 0. Only damage caused by foes or hazards powers the armor, not damage you take from yourself, allies, or the environment.</p>
