<p>Flare beacons create an incredibly bright light for a brief period of time. They are often used to signal others to the beacon's location, to coordinate assaults, to request rescue, or for other similar reasons. Higher-level beacons have a radius so large that they can be seen from miles away at night. When you Activate a flare beacon, you can either place it on the ground in a space within your reach or toss it up to 60 feet straight up. A flare beacon in the air falls at a rate of 10 feet per round.</p>

<p>The beacon then sparks into being, casting bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light in the next 20 feet for 1 minute. Creatures adjacent to a flare beacon must succeed at a <span data-pf2-check="fortitude" data-pf2-dc="15" data-pf2-traits="dazzle,consumable,gadget" data-pf2-label="Fortitude DC" data-pf2-show-dc="gm">Fortitude</span> save or be dazzled until they are no longer adjacent to it.</p>
