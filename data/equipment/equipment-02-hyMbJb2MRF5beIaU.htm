------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Activate</strong>&nbsp;Cast a Spell</p>
<p>An <em>archaic wayfinder</em> functions as a compass and acts as a repository for one cantrip cast into it. To fill an <em>archaic wayfinder</em>, a spellcaster casts the chosen cantrip into the empty device, providing any necessary cost; the spell cannot be one that is normally cast as a free action or reaction.</p>
<p>Activating an <em>archaic wayfinder</em> is the same as the casting for the relevant spell. Once it has been activated, it becomes empty again. An <em>archaic wayfinder</em> can hold an aeon stone and activate its resonant power. An archaic wayfinder counts against the limit of one wayfinder with a slotted resonant aeon stone.</p>
