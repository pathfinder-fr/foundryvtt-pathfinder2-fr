Name: Viper Arrow
Nom: 
État: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p><span>The shaft of this arrow is covered in fine green scales, and its iron head comes to a pair of points almost like fangs. After an activated viper arrow hits a target, the arrow transforms into a viper (Pathfinder Bestiary 302). The target is affected by the viper’s poison, as if it had been bitten. The viper then lands in an open space adjacent to the target.<br></span></p>
<p><span>The viper has the summoned trait and acts at the end of your turn, even though you didn’t use the Sustain a Spell action. It is under the GM’s control, but it generally attacks the creature the arrow struck. The viper vanishes after 1 minute or when slain.<br></span></p>
