------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">This unobtrusive belt pouch is popular among Pathfinders who operate in places where the Society is not welcome. It is constantly under the effects of a 3rd-level @Item[Magic Aura] spell to appear non-magical. The pouch&rsquo;s normal space holds as much as an ordinary belt pouch, but it also has a small extradimensional space that holds up to 1 Bulk of items. A creature actively inspecting the pouch in its ordinary state discovers the existence of the extradimensional space only on a critical success to Search the pouch (see the Concealing an Item action of the Stealth skill), though when the extradimensional space is active, it&rsquo;s obvious to anyone examining the pouch that it is more than it seems.</span></p>

This lasts until you next activate it. Items in the other space are inaccessible and hard to find until you switch the pouch back.</span></p>
