------ Description (en) ------
<p>These simple lenses are alchemically treated to detect the faint smoke trail from a piece of specially formulated sandalwood incense.</p>
<p>This incense has an odor undetectable by most people and a long burn time, making it perfect for discreetly tracking individuals. A stick of this incense costs 1 sp and can safely burn for up to 8 hours.</p>
<p>While wearing the lenses, you see alchemical fumes in a distinct green tint, granting you a +1 item bonus to Survival checks to Track a creature marked with the incense and to Perception checks to Seek any alchemical vapors.</p>
