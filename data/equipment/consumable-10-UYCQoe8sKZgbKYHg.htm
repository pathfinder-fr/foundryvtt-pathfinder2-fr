<p>These savory breaded snacks stuffed with cheese, peppers, and "secret ingredients" of draconic or demonic origin are often offered alongside a challenge-complete a full portion and get a free drink. For 1 hour after consuming follypops, your stomach gurgles and rumbles with magical potential. During this time, you can unleash magic in the area up to three times as a single action, which has the concentrate trait, with an area and damage determined by the type of pop; the third time you use this magic, the effects of your <em>follypops</em> end. All creatures within the area must attempt a DC 27 basic saving throw each time you unleash magic, as noted by the type of pop.</p>

<p>You begin to sweat profusely after consuming the serving. When you unleash magic, you breathe out a blast of fire in a <span data-pf2-effect-area="cone" data-pf2-distance="15">15-foot cone</span>.

<p><strong>Type</strong> rotters</p>
<p>Your breath smells of rotting garbage after you consume the serving. When you unleash magic, you exhale a noxious breath in a <span data-pf2-effect-area="cone" data-pf2-distance="15">15-foot cone</span>. Creatures in the cone take [[/r {4d6}[poison] #first blast]]{4d6 poison damage} with the first breath, [[/r {2d6}[poison] #second blast]]{2d6 poison damage} with the second breath, and [[/r {1d6}[poison] #third blast]]{1d6 poison damage} with the final breath.

<hr />
<p><strong>Type</strong> sizzlers</p>
<p>Your skin crawls and your hair stands on end after consuming the serving. When you unleash magic, you release a bolt of lightning from your hand that travels in a <span data-pf2-effect-area="line" data-pf2-distance="30">30-foot line</span>. The first bolt deals [[/r {2d12}[electricity] #first jolt]]{2d12 electricity damage}, the second [[/r {1d12}[electricity] #second jolt]]{1d12 electricity damage}, and the third [[/r {1d6}[electricity] #third jolt]]{1d6 electricity damage}.
