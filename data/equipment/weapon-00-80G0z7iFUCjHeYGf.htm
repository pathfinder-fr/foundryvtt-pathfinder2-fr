------ Description (en) ------
<p>This collapsible baton consists of several nested, telescoping metal shafts that can be extended as a free action by flicking the wrist. Once extended to its full length (usually around 2 feet), the baton locks into shape until the wielder uses an Interact action to collapse it-a collapsed nightstick is 8 inches long, making it easily concealed. Lighter and more maneuverable than an ordinary club or truncheon, nightsticks are designed to subdue foes without causing permanent injury. A nightstick is an uncommon simple melee weapon.</p>
