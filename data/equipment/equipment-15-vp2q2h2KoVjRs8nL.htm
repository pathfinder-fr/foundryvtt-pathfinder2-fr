<p><strong>Effect</strong> Your eidolon Concentrates on the medallion and their connection to you, allowing them to momentarily manifest into a stampede of dozens of copies of themself. The stampede rampages out in every direction, swerving around your allies while trampling any foe on the ground in an emanation around your eidolon with a radius equal to your eidolon's Speed. Each of these foes takes [[/r 12d6 #bludgeoning]]{12d6 bludgeoning damage}, with a <span data-pf2-check="reflex" data-pf2-traits="eidolon,evocation,invested,magical" data-pf2-label="Eidolon Stampede DC" data-pf2-dc="34" data-pf2-show-dc="gm">basic Reflex</span> save.
