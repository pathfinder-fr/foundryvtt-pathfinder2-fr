<p>This small rod has a tiny, sharp cutting wheel made of steel on one end and a thick bulb on the other. You can use the glass cutter’s wheel to score ordinary glass and use the bulb to break the piece along your scoring. It typically takes 1 minute of work to cut a hole large enough to fit your hand. If you are attempting to break the glass quietly, you must attempt a Thievery check against the Perception DC of nearby creatures to go unnoticed.</p>
