------ Description (en) ------
<p>Given to undisciplined acolytes at risk of breaking their vows, this fulu activates on its own if its wearer begins to perform an act anathema to a specific deity or cause, decided at the time of crafting. The fulu heats up when activated, giving you enough warning to correct your actions; if you proceed, the fulu immolates in a burst of flame. This deals [[/r 4d6 #fire]]{4d6 fire damage} and brands your skin until you receive an appropriate @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.7Fd4lxozd11MQ55N]{Atone} ritual. Either way, activating the fulu consumes it.</p>
