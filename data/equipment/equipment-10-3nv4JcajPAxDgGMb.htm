<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">This timeworn chalice is constructed of dull tin. It has an unassuming appearance save for the gold, silver, and ebony rings that encircle its rim.<br></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput"><strong>Activate</strong> <img class="actiondark" style="height: 15px; padding: 0px 2px 0px 2px;" src="https://2e.aonprd.com/Images/Actions/OneAction.png" alt="Single Action"> envision; <strong>Frequency</strong> three times per day; <strong>Effect</strong> The chalice fills with one of three different wines of your choosing, as described below. The wine looks, tastes, and smells the same regardless of which type you choose, and @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gpzpAAAJ1Lza2JVl]{Detect Magic} has no effect on the liquid beyond indicating that it is magical. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ordinary wine.</li>
<li>Wine that, when imbibed, casts a 2nd-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.SnaLVgxZ9ryUFmUr]{Restoration} spell&nbsp;on the drinker.</li>
<li>Wine that, when imbibed, casts a 4th-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Uqj344bezBq3ESdq]{Nightmare} spell on the drinker.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you aren’t chaotic, the first time each day you activate the chalice, there is a one-in-six chance that the liquid you conjure is a different type (the GM should roll 1d6 as a secret roll) instead. The second and third times you activate the chalice in the same day, the odds of this happening increase to two-in-six or three-in-six, respectively. If you are chaotic, the chalice always works as intended.&nbsp;</p>
