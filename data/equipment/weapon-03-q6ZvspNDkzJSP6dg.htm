------ Description (en) ------
<p><span>The blade of this <em>+1 greataxe</em> bears a design of a human skull. Whenever a creature damages you with an attack, the skull changes its appearance to look like the face of that creature. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your next damage roll against that creature before the end of your next turn. Because the face reshapes each time you&rsquo;re damaged, you get the additional damage only if you attack the creature that damaged you most recently.&nbsp;</span></p>
