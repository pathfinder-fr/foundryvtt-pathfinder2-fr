------ Description (en) ------
<p>Rose gold and copper rings in this <em>+2 resilient chain shirt</em> form a vague bird shape. The jingling links tinkle musically, almost like birdsong. While you wear the armor, effects with the auditory trait must first counteract the <em>harmonic hauberk</em> or they have no effect on you.</p>
<p>The <em>harmonic hauberk</em> attempts to counteract <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gIdDLrbswTV3OBJy]{Silence}</em> spells cast on you and 4th‑level or higher heightened <em>silence</em> spells the first time the armor enters their area (counteract level 4, counteract modifier [[/r 1d20+20 #Counteract]]{+20}). After failing to counteract a <em>silence</em> spell, the armor can't attempt to counteract the same spell again, even if you leave and enter the spell's area multiple times.</p>
