------ Description (en) ------
<p><span>A Large or smaller restrained or willing creature can be executed by a <em>final blade</em>. As an artifact, a <em>final blade</em> cannot be harmed by any but a very specific means.<br></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Activate</strong> 1 minute (Interact); <strong>Effect</strong> You execute a creature restrained beneath the blade. The executed creature takes 11d10 slashing damage and must succeed at a DC 45 Fortitude save or be decapitated as though it suffered a critical hit with a natural 20 from a +3 major striking</span> vorpal scythe. The soul of a creature executed with a final blade is trapped, and the creature can’t be returned to life through any means, even a miracle<em> or</em> similar magic. A <em>final blade</em> can hold any number of souls in this way, and they can be released only through a complex ritual known only to the Gray Gardeners or through the destruction of the <em>final blade</em>.</p>
