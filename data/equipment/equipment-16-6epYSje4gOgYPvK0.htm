------ Description (en) ------
<p>The tough, scaled leather of these heavy boots comes from a mighty dinosaur, granting you the steadiness of a lumbering beast. Any time an action or effect would cause you to make a forced movement, roll a <span data-pf2-check="flat" data-pf2-dc="17">DC 17 flat check</span>. On a success, the forced movement fails to affect you.</p>

<p><strong>Effect</strong> You grow to size Huge if you choose, with the effects of 4th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.wzctak6BxOW8xvFV]{Enlarge}</em> for 1 minute.

This deals an amount of damage to each creature equal to that of your foot unarmed attack (including any extra weapon damage dice, bonuses, or additional damage as normal), with a <span data-pf2-check="reflex" data-pf2-traits="uncommon,invested,magical,transmutation" data-pf2-label="Dinosaur Trample DC" data-pf2-dc="27" data-pf2-show-dc="all">basic Reflex</span> save.
