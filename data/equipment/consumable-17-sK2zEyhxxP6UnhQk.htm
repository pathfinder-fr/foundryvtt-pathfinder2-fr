<p>These sets of rockets come in pairs and strap onto existing footwear (or a creature's feet). Inserting them and aligning them properly takes 1 minute. When you Activate the major blast boots to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.2HJ4yuEFY1Cast4h]{High Jump}, you can increase the vertical distance of your High Jump by up to 80 feet. When you Activate them to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.JUvAvruz7yRQXfz2]{Long Jump}, you can increase the horizontal distance of your Long Jump by up to 120 feet. Additionally, for 1 minute, the major blast boots remain active, allowing you to clumsily fly through the air for the duration. You gain a 30-foot Fly speed for the duration, but any time you @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.cS9nfDRGD83bNU1p]{Fly}, you are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.i3OJZU2nk64Df3xm]{Clumsy 1} until the start of your next turn.</p>
