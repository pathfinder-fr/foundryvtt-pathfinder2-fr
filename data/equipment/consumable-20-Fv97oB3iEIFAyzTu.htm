<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">An alchemist with the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.zOK6IFSz3DIBRjEw]{Craft Philosopher's Stone} feat can create a philosopher’s stone once per month by spending 1 batch of infused reagents during their daily preparations using the advanced alchemy class feature. This is the only way to create a philosopher’s stone.</span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">At a glance, a philosopher’s stone appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of natural rock. Breaking the rock open with a Force Open action (DC 35) reveals a cavity at the stone’s heart. The cavity is lined with a rare type of quicksilver that can transmute base metals into precious metals or create an elixir of rejuvenation.&nbsp;<br></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">To use the quicksilver, you must be legendary in Crafting and have the Alchemical Crafting&nbsp;feat. You can then use the stone’s quicksilver for one of two effects: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>You can apply the stone’s quicksilver to an infused true elixir of life using an Interact action.&nbsp;This turns the elixir into an infused elixir of rejuvenation instantaneously. This doesn’t require any crafting time or additional materials.</li>
<li>You can spend up to a month of downtime applying the quicksilver either to iron to create silver or to lead to create gold. Treat this as a 20th-level task to Earn Income using Crafting, except that you create 500 gp worth of your chosen metal per day on a success or 750 gp worth per day on a critical success.</li>
</ul>
