------ Description (en) ------
When created, this mutagen is attuned to your choice of one of four energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. When consumed, the mutagen suffuses your body with energy that spills out of you whenever you attack. At higher levels, it can even grant you the ability to unleash the energy in controlled bursts. You gain resistance 20, add 2d6 damage on a hit with a melee weapon, and the duration is 1 hour. In addition, you can end the benefits of this mutagen to unleash a 30-foot cone of energy that deals 3d6 damage of the attuned type for every full 10 minutes of duration remaining (DC 32 basic Reflex save).
