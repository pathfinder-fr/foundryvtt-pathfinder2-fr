<p>This silver chalice bears the symbol of Pharasma, a swirling cloud that transforms into a flight of whippoorwills that encircle the top. The chalice can be activated in one of two ways, though only once per day total.</p>

<p><strong>Effect</strong> The chalice fills with a single vial's worth of <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.efFe4EK7ThUrH446]{Holy Water}</em>. The water loses its potency after 1 day if poured into any container other than a font specifically sanctified by a cleric of Pharasma. It similarly loses its potency 1 day after being removed from such a font.</p>

<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The <em>Lady's Chalice</em> is full of a vial's worth of <em>holy water</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The chalice splashes a spiral of <em>holy water</em> into an adjacent space. This is a simple thrown weapon with a range of 5 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the manipulate trait to the attack made with it. If it hits, it deals 2d6 good damage and 2 good splash damage (including to you, if you're evil).</p>
