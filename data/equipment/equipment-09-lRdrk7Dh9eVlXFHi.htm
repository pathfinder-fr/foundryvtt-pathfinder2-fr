------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">A <em>dreamstone</em> is a disc-shaped object carved with imagery or words sacred to Desna&mdash;be it her religious symbol, a short prayer, or merely the shape of a single star. When you carry a <em>dreamstone</em>, you find it easier to fall asleep, and you gain improved effects from the resulting rest. You always fall asleep within 5 minutes of lying down with the intention of sleeping, and you require only 2 hours of sleep per day to gain the benefits of 8 hours of sleep, provided you have carried the <em>dreamstone</em> for at least 24 hours prior to resting. As long as you carry a <em>dreamstone</em>, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against sleep effects.<br /></span></p>
