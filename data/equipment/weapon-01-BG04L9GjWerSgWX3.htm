------ Description (en) ------
<p>This bladder of water explodes when put under pressure or upon being punctured, dealing minimal damage, neutralizing acids, and dousing flames. The bomb deals [[/r {1}[nonlethal,bludgeoning]]]{1 nonlethal bludgeoning damage} and [[/r {1}[nonlethal,splash,bludgeoning]]]{1 nonlethal bludgeoning splash damage}. On a hit, if the target is suffering from @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Acid or Persistent Fire Damage}, it can attempt a flat check to end that persistent damage immediately. As this is particularly effective assistance, the DC of the flat check is reduced from 15 to 10 for this check. On a hit against an unattended, non-magical fire, the bomb extinguishes the fire, or extinguishes one square of fire for a larger fire.</p>
