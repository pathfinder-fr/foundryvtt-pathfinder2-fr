------ Description (en) ------
<p>This clear quartz stone appears to have been smashed and then repaired by pouring molten copper into the cracks and fitting the shards back together using the copper as a sort of mortar. When a non-magical item in your possession with a value of 90 gp or less and a Bulk of 1 Bulk or less would become broken, this aeon stone automatically activates, preventing the item from breaking by restoring the item's current Hit Points to the item's maximum Hit Points. The stone then turns permanently into a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.CVTbxCY85nLoHYuw]{Aeon Stone (Dull Grey)}</em>.</p>
<p>The stone's resonant power allows you to cast 1st-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.dINQzhqGmIsqGMUY]{Mending}</em> as a divine innate spell once per day.</p>
