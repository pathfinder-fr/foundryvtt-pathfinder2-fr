The whistle sprouts from one into several, and then creates a large wooden frame and keyboard.

The calliope is heavy and anchored in place.<br></span></p>

<p><span>If you use an Interact action to pull the small metal ring on the underside of the <em>marvelous calliope</em>, the calliope collapses back down into a slide whistle.<br></span></p>
