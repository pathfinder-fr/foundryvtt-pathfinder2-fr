------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">This large slide whistle appears to be made of fine brass, the sides of which are engraved with musical notes and dancing clowns.<br></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput"><strong>Activate</strong> 1 minute (command, envision, Interact); <strong>Effect</strong> You blow a tune upon the slide whistle, causing the whistle to expand. The whistle sprouts from one into several, and then creates a large wooden frame and keyboard. By the time the unfolding is complete, the whistle fully transforms into a calliope, a wagon-sized contraption consisting of several steam whistles played like an organ. The calliope is heavy and anchored in place.<br></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You have a +1 item bonus to Performance checks to play the calliope. The calliope has a tendency to produce music for a few seconds after you cease playing it, adding a jaunty and overlong conclusion to your music.<br></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">If you use an Interact action to pull the small metal ring on the underside of the <em>marvelous calliope</em>, the calliope collapses back down into a slide whistle.<br></span></p>
