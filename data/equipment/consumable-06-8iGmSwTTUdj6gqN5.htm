------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Stored in a small reed, this powder looks like a fine metallic dust. When you fling it in the air, it coats all creatures in a 10-foot burst centered on a point within 5 feet of you. For 1 minute, the coated creatures can&rsquo;t be concealed or invisible, nor can they benefit from <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=197"><em>mirror image</em></a> or similar abilities that create illusory duplicates. Any illusions in the area of 3rd level or lower are revealed as such, although this does not end their effect.<br /></span></p>
