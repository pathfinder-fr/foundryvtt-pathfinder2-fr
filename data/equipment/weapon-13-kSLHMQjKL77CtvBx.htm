<p><strong>Effect</strong> The spear embeds itself into the creature, and the spear's haft splits along the silver lines to become a series of hooks attached to a thin but strong cable. As long as the <em>anchor spear</em> remains embedded in the creature, any time the creature burrows or climbs, it treats normal terrain as difficult terrain and difficult terrain as greater difficult terrain. The creature can spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 32 Athletics check to remove the spearhead.</p>
