------ Description (en) ------
<p>This long, thin +1 striking wounding dagger has a smooth edge on one side and a serrated edge on the other. Its persistent bleed damage comes from slicing away long strips of the target’s flesh, and it deals [[/r 1d8 #persistent bleed]] persistent bleed damage on a hit instead of 1d6. A creature takes a –2 status penalty to saving throws against diseases for as long as it has persistent bleed damage from this knife.</p>
