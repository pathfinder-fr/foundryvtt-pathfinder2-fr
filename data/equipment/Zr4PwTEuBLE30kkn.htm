<p><span class="fontstyle0">This entry is a catchall for basic hand tools that don’t have a specific adventuring purpose. A hoe, shovel, or sledgehammer is a long tool, and a hand drill, ice hook, or trowel is a short tool. A tool can usually be used as an improvised weapon, dealing 1d4 damage for a short tool or 1d6 for a long tool. The GM determines the damage type that’s appropriate or adjusts the damage if needed.</span> </p>
