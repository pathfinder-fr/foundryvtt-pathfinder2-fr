<p>You need thieves’ tools to Pick Locks or Disable Devices (of some types) using the Thievery skill. Infiltrator thieves’ tools add a +1 item bonus to checks&nbsp; to Pick Locks and Disable Devices. If your thieves’ tools are broken, you can repair them by replacing the lock picks with replacement picks appropriate to your tools; this doesn’t require using the Repair action.&nbsp;</p>
