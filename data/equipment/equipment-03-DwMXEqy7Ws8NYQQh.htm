------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">This item consists of two magically linked rings: an intricate, gleaming golden ring with a square-cut ruby, and a thick, plain iron ring. When you wield a melee weapon in the hand wearing the golden ring, the weapon&rsquo;s fundamental runes are replicated onto any melee weapon you wield in&nbsp;the hand wearing the iron ring. (The fundamental runes are <em>weapon potency</em> and <em>striking</em>, which add an item bonus to attack rolls and extra weapon damage dice, respectively.) Any fundamental runes on the weapon in the hand wearing the iron ring are suppressed.<br /></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">The replication functions only if you wear both rings, and it ends as soon as you cease wielding a melee weapon in one of your hands. Consequently, the benefit doesn&rsquo;t apply to thrown attacks or if you&rsquo;re holding a weapon but not wielding it (such as holding in one hand a weapon that requires two hands to wield).</span></p>
