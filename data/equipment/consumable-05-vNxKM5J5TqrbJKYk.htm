<hr />
<p>This dried eye was plucked from a magical creature. You combine your observation about your enemy's reaction to your Strike with the stores of magical wisdom within the talisman to try to glean more information about the foe's true nature. When you activate this talisman, you attempt to Recall Knowledge about the creature you hit. If you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.</p>
