------ Description (en) ------
<p>This footlong length of conductive cable is capped on both ends by grounded handles containing Stasian coils. These coils can be turned on or off as a single action. While on, the coils electrify the cable, dealing [[/r {1d6}[electricity]]]{1d6 electricity} and [[/r {1d6}[fire]]]{1d6 fire damage} in a thin precise line to anything the cable touches, though the cable is too unwieldy to use as a weapon. Electrocables are typically used to "cut" a thin straight line through metal. They ignore 10 points of a metal object's hardness.</p>
