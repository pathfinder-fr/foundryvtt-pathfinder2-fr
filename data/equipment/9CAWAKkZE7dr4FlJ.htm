------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">These symbols convey protective forces from the Elemental Planes. You gain resistance 10 to acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The crafter chooses the damage type when creating the rune. Multiple <em>energy-resistant</em> runes can be etched onto a suit of armor; rather than using only the highest-level effect, each must provide resistance to a different damage type. For instance, a <em>+2 acid-resistant greater fire-resistant breastplate</em> would give you acid resistance 5 and fire resistance 10.</span></p>
