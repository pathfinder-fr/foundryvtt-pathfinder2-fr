------ Description (en) ------
<p>This watery, mint-green emetic of xulgath design is often carried in a delicate obsidian vial or other fragile container. In the unfortunate circumstance that a creature has been Swallowed Whole by another creature, the swallowed creature can break open a vial of greengut to immediately induce vomiting. The swallower must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude save or take 18d6 poison damage and possibly vomit the contents of its stomach.&nbsp;</p>
