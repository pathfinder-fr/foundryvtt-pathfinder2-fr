<p><strong>Effect</strong> If your next action is to cast a harmful necromancy spell that you prepared from this grimoire and that allows a saving throw, you warp and twist negative energy into the spell to cause intense pain. If the target fails its saving throw against the spell, it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} by the pain.</p>
