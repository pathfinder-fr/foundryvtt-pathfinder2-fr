------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Each feather token appears to be a simple feather from some exotic bird. The feather&rsquo;s shaft, dipped in gold, bears a single arcane rune. Activating a feather token causes it to transform into another object, which then can be used as normal for that object. Each feather can be activated only once, with most of them permanently becoming the item in their description.<br /></span></p>

<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">This feather transforms into a <em>+1 striking <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=293">dancing whip</a></em> when activated. The whip immediately jumps from your grasp and proceeds to attack your enemies until 1 minute has passed or it fails its flat check for <em>dancing</em>, at which point it vanishes. If the whip&rsquo;s target isn&rsquo;t prone, the whip uses its actions to attempt to Trip that creature instead of making a Strike. The whip&rsquo;s total attack modifier for Striking or Tripping is +18 instead of the normal bonus for a <em>dancing</em> weapon.&nbsp;</span></p>
