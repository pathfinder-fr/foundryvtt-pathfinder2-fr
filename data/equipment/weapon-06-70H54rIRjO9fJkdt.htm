------ Description (en) ------
<p>A <em>spider gun</em> is a <em>+1 striking weapon</em>. It's a distinct type of martial firearm made from the fangs and spinneret of a Large spider. It deals [[/r {1d10}[poison]]]{1d10 poison damage} with a range increment of 30 feet and reload 1. On a critical hit, the venom clings to the target and they take @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent poison Damage} equal to [[/r {1d4+1+@item.runes.striking}[persistent,poison]]]{1d4 + the number of weapon damage dice}. A <em>spider gun</em> does not add critical specialization effects. The gun can be activated to fire webbing that hampers other creatures.</p>

<p><strong>Effect</strong> You fire a mass of webbing at a square within 30 feet. That square becomes covered in webbing for 1 minute. A square covered with the webbing from a <em>spider gun</em> can be cleared by a single attack or effect that deals at least 5 slashing damage} or 1 fire damage. A square has AC 5, and it automatically fails its saving throws. The first time each turn a creature in the webbing begins to use a move action or enters the webbing during a move action, it must attempt an <span data-pf2-check="athletics" data-pf2-traits="conjuration,magical" data-pf2-label="Spider Gun Athletics DC" data-pf2-dc="20">Athletics</span> check or <span data-pf2-check="reflex" data-pf2-traits="conjuration,magical" data-pf2-label="Spider Gun Reflex DC" data-pf2-dc="20">Reflex</span> save against DC 20. On a success, it moves normally through the webbing and clears away the webbing from any squares it enters this turn. On a failure, it treats squares of webbing as difficult terrain this turn, and on a critical failure, it's @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} for 1 round or until it @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escapes} (DC 20) or destroys the webbing.</p>
<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> The initial raw materials for the <em>spider gun</em> must include the fangs and spinneret of a giant spider or other Large spider.</p>
