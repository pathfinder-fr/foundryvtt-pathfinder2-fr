<p><strong>Effect</strong> The bone begins recording the next 1 minute of ambient sounds (including speech) that require a DC 15 or lower Perception check to hear. The bone's recording doesn't copy magical auditory effects, such as those of spellcasting, a harpy's song, or a banshee's wail. Once the rhythm bone has been activated in this way, it retains the recorded sound for the rest of its existence and can't be activated this way again.</p>
