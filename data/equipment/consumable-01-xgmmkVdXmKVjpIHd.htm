------ Description (en) ------
<p>A dull gray aeon stone has lost its special magical properties, sometimes as a result of overusing a tourmaline sphere or pale lavender ellipsoid aeon stone. It still orbits your head like any other aeon stone and can thus serve as a stylish, hands-free option for various spells that target an object, like continual flame.</p>
<p>Dull gray aeon stones have no resonant power.</p>
