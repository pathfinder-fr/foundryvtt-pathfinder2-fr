------ Description (en) ------
<p>You carefully pack rare, heat-absorbing powders into a specially prepared clay vessel, then bury the vessel in the ground up to its neck. When a creature enters the square, the vessel's neck shatters, dispersing the powders into the air. The powder instantly douses non-magical fires the size of a campfire or smaller within 10 feet of the snare. The creature triggering the snare must attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:20] save to avoid getting powder in its face. A creature @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} by the powder can use an Interact action to attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:10|showDC:owner] check; on a success, it removes the condition. On a failure, it can try again, with a @Check[type:flat|dc:5|showDC:owner] check on the next Interact check. If it fails a second time, it automatically removes the condition with a third Interact action.</p>
<hr />
