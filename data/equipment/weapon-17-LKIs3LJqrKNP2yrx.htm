------ Description (en) ------
<p>The blade of this <em>+2 greater striking adamantine longsword</em> seems to absorb light from the air around it, giving the impression the wielder is standing in the shadow of a much larger creature.</p>
<p>While <em>Spellcutter</em> is a potent weapon for battling undead and constructs, an ancient restriction on the blade prevents it from harming living creatures; attacks against living beings deal no damage. This restriction doesn't apply to dhampirs or creatures with the @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.TTCw5NusiSSkJU1x]{Negative Healing} ability who are otherwise living; the magic of the blade can't distinguish between such beings and undead.</p>

<p><strong>Effect</strong> Touching <em>Spellcutter</em> to any light source of 12th level or lower (including 6th-level spells with the light trait) instantly extinguishes the effect. If the source of the light is a large flame, such as a forest fire or bonfire, it only extinguishes the light source in a 5-foot radius burst from the point of contact.</p>
