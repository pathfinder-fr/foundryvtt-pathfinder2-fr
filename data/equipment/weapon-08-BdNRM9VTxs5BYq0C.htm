<hr />
<p><em>Jax</em> was a caravan guard who died defending her charges from a pack of Lamashtan cultists in the Spellscar Desert. Her spirit of fury and hopelessness infused her weapon upon her death, imbuing the firearm with a fragment of her soul and intelligence. The rifle, upon awakening, remembered just enough of <em>Jax</em>'s former life to think of her former wielder's name as her own.</p>
<p><em>Jax</em> is a <em>+1 striking fearsome piercing wind</em> whose driving purpose is to protect innocent travelers in the Spellscar Desert from raiders, bandits, and cultists. <em>Jax</em> allows any creature to wield her, but she doesn't reveal her intelligence or powers until she detects an innocent in danger or if her wielder has proven themselves a worthy champion of justice. If she deems a wielder to be unworthy, <em>Jax</em> uses her dominate ability to control the wielder until she can find a new one.</p>
<p>If ever used to attack an innocent traveler, or if, in <em>Jax</em>'s opinion, the attack could be considered banditry, the weapon automatically misfires. If <em>Jax</em> witnesses an innocent harmed or killed, she empathically urges her wielder to avenge the victim. If the wielder doesn't comply, <em>Jax</em> attempts to cast dominate (below). Even if the dominate spell fails, <em>Jax</em> withholds all magical abilities, including the +1 weapon potency rune and striking rune, until her wielder redeems themself.</p>

<p><strong>Effect</strong> <em>Jax</em> deems you an unworthy agent of justice. She casts<em> @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.OsOhx3TGIZ7AhD0P]{Dominate}</em> on you (@Check[type:will|dc:24|name:Dominate|traits:mental,incapacitation,divine,spell,enchantment|overrideTraits:true]). If you're chaotic or a worshipper of Lamashtu, you take a -2 penalty to your Will save, and the result of your save is one degree of success worse than the result you rolled. <em>Jax</em> orders you to fight banditry and protect innocent travelers in the Spellscar Desert, renewing the spell as often as necessary until you cease your lawless ways.</p>
