<p><strong>Transform Statue</strong>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Pathfinder2eActions'; font-size: 1.8em; display: inline;">2</span>&nbsp;(concentrate, manipulate) <strong>Effect</strong> You place the statue on solid ground and speak the rat&rsquo;s secret name, causing the statuette to transform into a living giant rat (page 75). In creature form, the giant rat acts on your turn. It gets 2 actions and can&rsquo;t use reactions. You have to spend an action each turn to tell it what to do; otherwise, it tries to run away from danger or cowers where it is. If the rat is slain while in animal form, it reverts to its statue shape and can&rsquo;t be transformed again until 1 week has passed. If the figurine is destroyed while in its statue form, it&rsquo;s shattered and its magical properties are lost forever.</p>
