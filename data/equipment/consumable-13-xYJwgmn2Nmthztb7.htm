<hr />
<p>This carved chunk of amber contains a single tuft of gray feathers, which spark with electricity to create an odd jittery sensation in anyone holding the amber for long. When used as part of a @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.r3NeUnsgt9mS03Sn]{Shocking Grasp} spell, thunderbird tuft funnels electricity back into the spellcaster in a defensive nimbus. For 1 minute, any creature that touches you or that hits you with a melee unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon attack takes [[/r 3d4 #electricity]]{3d4 electricity damage}([[/r 3d6 #electricity]]{3d6 electricity damage} if the creature is using a metal weapon).</p>
