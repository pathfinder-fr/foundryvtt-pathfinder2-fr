<p>This fan is useful for elegant dances as well as for slicing unsuspecting foes with the blades along its outer edge. If used in performances, it might be disguised as a frilly accessory, or it might be an obvious, though elegant, weapon.</p>
<p>This elegant +3 greater striking flaming silver fighting fan features sharp silver feathers instead of traditional paper leaves in its design.</p>

<p><strong>Effect</strong> You call upon the fan's extradimensional powers to trap a creature in Hao Jin's repository, a small demiplane that holds the countless relics Hao Jin collected over her lifetime (though a trapped creature cannot interact with any of these relics). The fighting fan casts @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Oj1PJBMQD9vuwCv7]{Maze} on a creature within 30 feet. The fan automatically Sustains the Spell as long as you Strike a creature with it each round.
