------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">This compact compass repurposes ancient technology to draw fantastic powers from the mysterious magical items called aeon stones. It serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society and as a status symbol among adventurers of any stripe. A wayfinder functions as a compass.</span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">An indentation in the middle of the <em>wayfinder</em> can hold a single <em>aeon stone</em>. Placing an <em>aeon stone</em> in this indentation provides you all the benefits of having the <em>aeon stone</em> orbiting your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily. You invest a <em>wayfinder</em> and the <em>aeon stone</em> within it simultaneously, and they count as only one item toward your investiture limit. An invested <em>aeon stone</em> slotted in a <em>wayfinder</em> also grants its resonant power.<br></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">If you have more than one <em>wayfinder</em> with an invested <em>aeon stone</em> on your person at a given time, destructive interference from their resonance prevents you from gaining benefits from any of them. You can still benefit from additional <em>aeon stones</em> orbiting your head, just not in <em>wayfinders</em>.<br></span></p>
