<p>Black powder is a volatile and explosive alchemical substance commonly used in the production of firearm munitions. Black powder becomes inert and useless when wet and must be kept in a sealed, water-tight container.</p>
<p>A horn contains 500 doses worth of black powder. A horn can be detonated by leaving a small trail of black powder and then lighting it. Each 5-foot square requires one dose of black powder to create a trail through. As long as the horn is mostly full (at least 400 doses remaining) it can be detonated to deal [[/r {1d6}[fire]]]{1d6 fire damage} in a @Template[type:burst|distance:5] (<span data-pf2-check="reflex" data-pf2-traits="damaging-effect, alchemical, consumable" data-pf2-label="Gunpowder Detonation DC" data-pf2-dc="16" data-pf2-show-dc="gm">basic Reflex</span> save). It takes 1 round per 15 feet of powder trail laid down for a horn to detonate after the trail is lit. If multiple horns detonate simultaneously, it can increase the area of the explosion, but the damage in overlapping areas doesn't increase.</p>
