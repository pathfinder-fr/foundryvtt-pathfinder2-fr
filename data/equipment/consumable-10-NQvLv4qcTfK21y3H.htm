<hr />
<p>This classic fulu seals the negative energy within an undead, freezing it in its tracks. Upon affixing, the target undead must attempt a <span data-pf2-check="will" data-pf2-traits="fulu" data-pf2-label="spirit-sealing fulu DC" data-pf2-dc="27" data-pf2-show-dc="all">Will</span> save or be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed} for 1 round. On a critical failure, the undead is paralyzed for 4 rounds. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt a new Will save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round, or end it entirely on a critical success.</p>
