------ Description (en) ------
<p>This ring magically conceals any armor and sheathed weapons you're wearing by either turning them invisible or creating the illusion of ordinary clothes. The ring doesn't change your appearance beyond concealing weapons and armor. As soon as you wield a weapon, the weapon becomes obvious to onlookers and is no longer affected by the ring until you sheathe the weapon for at least 1 minute. A creature can disbelieve this illusion by Seeking or any time it hits you with an attack.</p>
