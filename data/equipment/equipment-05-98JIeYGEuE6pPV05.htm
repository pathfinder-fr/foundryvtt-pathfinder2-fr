------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">This surprisingly sturdy 3-foot-by-3-foot clay tile resembles a thick pressure plate. It can support up to 500 pounds of weight atop it before it is destroyed. The <em>floorbell's</em> nature is obvious at a glance, but mundane or magical means can obscure or camouflage the tile (such as by covering it in scattered leaves or by casting an @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.2oH5IufzdESuYxat]{Illusory Object} spell) to make it harder to detect.<br /><br /><strong>Activate</strong> <span style="font-family: 'Pathfinder2eActions'; font-size: 1.8em; display: inline;">2</span> command, Interact; <strong>Effect</strong> The <em>floorbell</em> must be activated on level ground. When you do, specify the amount of weight that triggers the <em>floorbell's</em> alarm system. When the amount of weight you specify (or more) is placed on the <em>floorbell</em>, it emits an ear-piercing wail clearly audible to a range of 150 feet. A <em>floorbell</em> can also ring an alarm if a weight you specify is removed from the <em>floorbell</em>, such as if you activated it while a heavy sack was on it.</span></p>
