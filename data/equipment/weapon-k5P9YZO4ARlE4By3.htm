------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">These ominous swords are decorated with crimson lacquer and serve as perfect conduits for the Crimson Oath&rsquo;s power. The first was granted to Clarethe Iomedar by a mysterious patron who many Reclaimers believe to be an emissary of Ragathiel. A crimson brand is a +1 striking wounding bastard sword. When the wielder uses the crimson brand to cast invoke the Crimson Oath, they can generate a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone instead of the normal 20-foot cone. Whenever the wielder would inflict persistent bleed damage on an undead creature with the <em>crimson brand</em>, they can instead wreathe the creature in ruby energy, inflicting the same amount of persistent positive damage instead of persistent bleed damage.</span></p>
