------ Description (en) ------
<p>The handle of this braided leather +1 striking whip is made from the hairs of a variety of rare and mythical animals. When used against an animal, the whip of complia<em>nce</em> can potentially force the target to follow your commands.</p>
<p><span><strong>Activate</strong> <span style="font-family: 'Pathfinder2eActions'; font-size: 1.8em; display: inline;">A</span> command; <strong>Effect</strong> Until the end of your current turn, any animals you Strike with the whip must attempt a DC 25 Will save. On a failed or critically failed saving throw, the whip casts a 4th-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.qwlh6aDgi86U3Q7H]{Suggestion} spell on the animal with a base duration of 1 round, and the spell loses the linguistic trait. The course of action must still fulfill <em>suggestion's</em> requirements. If you can cast spells, you can expend one of your spells of 4th level or higher as a part of activating the whip; if you do so, the <em>suggestions</em> this turn have their normal base duration.</span></p>
