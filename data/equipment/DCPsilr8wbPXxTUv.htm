At the end of your turn each round, the weapon can Fly up to its fly Speed of 40 feet, and then can either Fly again or Strike one creature within its reach.<br /><br />The weapon has a space of 5 feet, but it doesn&rsquo;t block or impede enemies attempting to move though that space, nor does it benefit from or provide flanking. The weapon can&rsquo;t move through an enemy&rsquo;s space. The weapon can&rsquo;t use reactions, and its Fly actions don&rsquo;t trigger reactions.<br /></span></p>
