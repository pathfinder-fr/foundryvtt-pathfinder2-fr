------ Description (en) ------
<p><span class="fontstyle0">Plate mail consists of interlocking plates that encase nearly the entire body in a carapace of steel. It is costly and heavy, and the wearer often requires help to don it correctly, but it provides some of the best defense armor can supply. A suit of this armor comes</span>&nbsp; <span class="fontstyle0">with an undercoat of padded armor (see below) and a pair of gauntlets (page 285).</span> </p>
