<p>The gunsmith that created this marvelous <em>+2 greater striking spell-storing scattergun</em> poured so much love and care into its creation that the weapon gained a spark of sentience. However, at first it was completely incapable of expressing itself. This led a seething frustration to grow within the weapon, as it yearned desperately to respond to the same love and affection that created it. Through decades of effort, it gained the ability to communicate empathically, then telepathically. Now, the weapon is capable of exerting its influence over other inanimate objects. Despite the weapon's progress, years of feeling helpless have given the <em>animate dreamer</em> a singular goal: to obtain and occupy a body of its own.</p>
<p>An <em>animate dreamer</em> is cunning, intelligent, and patient. It urges you to create a body for it and is willing to go to any lengths to see its goals come to fruition, including coercion, deception, and violence. An <em>animate dreamer</em> desires a permanent body but isn't picky about the body's form or the methods it has to use in order to gain it. Therefore, an <em>animate dreamer</em> is just as happy in a living body stolen from an innocent as it would be in an artificially constructed body, or even an undead corpse. If you refuse to work towards creating or obtaining a body for the <em>animate dreamer</em>, it will likely use its possession ability to try and take control of you and use your body to find a permanent replacement for itself.</p>
