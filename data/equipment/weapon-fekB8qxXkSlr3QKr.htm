------ Description (en) ------
<p>This crossbow can deliver alchemically infused bolts. The strange weapon has a metal bracket mounted on the side of the stock near the lath. As an action, you can load a single lesser alchemical bomb into the bracket; this bomb must be one that deals energy damage (such as an acid flask, alchemist&rsquo;s fire, bottled lightning, frost vial, or thunderstone).</p>
<p>The next three attacks made with the crossbow deal 1d6 damage of the bomb&rsquo;s damage type in addition to the crossbow&rsquo;s normal damage. If the second and third attacks are not all made within 1 minute of the first attack, the bomb&rsquo;s energy is wasted. These attacks never deal splash damage or other special effects of the bomb and are not modified by any abilities that add to or modify a bomb&rsquo;s effect.</p>
<p>The addition of the bracket serves to unbalance the weapon, reducing its range to 30 feet. It otherwise functions as a crossbow (when determining damage, reload, and so on). Creatures use their crossbow proficiency when using the alchemical crossbow.</p>
