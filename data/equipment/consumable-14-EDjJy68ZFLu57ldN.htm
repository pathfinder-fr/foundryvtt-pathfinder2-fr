<p><strong>Activate</strong> Cast a Spell</p>
<hr />
<p>Sold only in single sticks, this foul incense comes coated with a bevy of alchemical smoke that activates in the presence of intense heat, releasing its namesake pungent odor. Adding this catalyst to a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.IarZrgCeaiUqOuRu]{Wall of Fire}</em> spell fills all squares adjacent to the wall with thick, foul smoke. Creatures in this area are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed}, and other creatures are concealed to creatures in the area. The smoke lasts for the duration of the spell. The incense can be used with a <em>wall of fire</em> of any level.</p>
