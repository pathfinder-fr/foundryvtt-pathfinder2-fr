------ Description (en) ------
<p>This <em>+2 striking dogslicer</em> is obviously the work of a brilliant but scrappy artisan who valued versatility over safety. Four toothy gems line the blade's cutting edge, three of which glow-one with fiery red light, one with a chill blue, and one that gives off sparks-while the last is a glistening black. Each of these gems embodies a weapon property rune, but only one rune can be active at a time.</p>

<p><strong>Effect</strong> You twist the gem along the blade corresponding with the desired weapon rune: red for <em>flaming</em>, blue for <em>frost</em>, or yellow for <em>shock</em>. You take 1d6 damage of the type the chosen rune deals. You can instead twist the black gem to disable the active property rune, taking no damage.</p>
