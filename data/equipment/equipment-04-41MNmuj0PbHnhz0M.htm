------ Description (en) ------
<p>This small, enchanted bone (most often a jaw) is usually capped with metal at its ends. It's activated by striking it against a hard surface.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class="pf2-icon">1</span> Interact;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The bone begins recording the next 10 minutes of ambient sounds (including speech) that require a DC 20 or lower Perception check to hear. The bone's recording doesn't copy magical auditory effects, such as those of spellcasting, a harpy's song, or a banshee's wail. Once the rhythm bone has been activated in this way, it retains the recorded sound for the rest of its existence and can't be activated this way again.</p>
<hr />

<p><strong>Effect</strong> The bone replays its recorded sounds.</p>
