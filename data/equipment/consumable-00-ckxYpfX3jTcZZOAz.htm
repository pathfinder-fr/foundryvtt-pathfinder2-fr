<p>Firearms require ammunition consisting of a projectile and black powder. A round of ammo can vary in its composition but is typically either a prepackaged paper cartridge, including wadding, bullet, and black powder, or loose shot packed in manually.

Because making rounds of firearm ammunition requires creating black powder, you need the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.is3Oz9wt11lNq62K]{Alchemical Crafting} skill feat to make them. Firearm rounds are a valid option for magical ammunition, just like arrows or bolts. Crafting magical firearm ammunition requires you to be able to craft both alchemical and magical items.</p>
