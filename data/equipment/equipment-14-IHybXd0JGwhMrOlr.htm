<p>Granted by Katapesh&rsquo;s Pactmasters to influential merchants, exceptional Zephyr Guards, and favorite retainers, these blue crystal&ndash;studded platinum rings sharpen their wearers&rsquo; urban instincts. You gain a +3 item bonus to Mercantile Lore checks while wearing the ring, and you can attempt checks that require a proficiency rank of master in Society. While invested, the ring grants a +2 item bonus to saving throws while you are in an urban setting, and this increases to a +3 item bonus if you have legendary proficiency in Guild Lore, Katapesh Lore, Mercantile Lore, or Society.</p>
