------ Description (en) ------
<p>A classical weapon of Irrisenis who lacked magical talent, the sickle-saber has seen a resurgence since the coronation of Queen Anastasia. The queen was fascinated with the sickle-sabers in the palace treasury, and now the unusual blades are carried by her honor guard and Irriseni diplomats alike. The sickle‑saber's blade curves multiple times along its 4‑foot length, and its hilt is similarly curved. A small, secondary grip on the blade lets the wielder rapidly and unpredictably twist the cutting edges. Characters from Irrisen have access to the sickle-saber.</p>
