------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">This ornate silver ring bears two competing geometric designs of brightly colored and wildly clashing inlaid gemstones. A spellcaster can cast a single spell into this ring as long as no spell is currently stored within, expending the normal time, costs, and so forth to Cast the Spell. The spell&rsquo;s effect doesn&rsquo;t occur; the spell&rsquo;s power is instead stored within the ring.<br /></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">When you invest a <em>ring of counterspells</em>, you immediately know the name and level of the spell stored inside, if any. A <em>ring of counterspells</em> found as treasure has a 50% chance of having a spell stored in it. The GM determines that spell.<br /></span></p>
