<hr />
<p>Profane powers of vengeance are yours to inflict.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong> When a creature deals damage to you, you can call out for retribution as a reaction. Until the end of your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls against that creature.</p>
<p><strong>Payment</strong> If you wound a creature, it is your duty to kill it. If a creature survives for 24 hours after you deal it damage, you are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed 1}. If you already have the doomed condition, it increases by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Condition</strong> No more than once per year, the erinys can compel you to attack a creature of the erinys’s choice that you can see. You are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.9qGBRpbX9NEwtAAr]{Controlled} by the erinys and must fight the chosen creature for 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong>Termination Clause</strong> The contract demands that you enact bloody vengeance against anyone who has ever wronged you, but the nature of the vengeance is vague. You can end the contract by creating effigies of everyone you believe has ever wronged you, bleeding upon them all at once (at least 1 Hit Point per effigy), and destroying them.</p>
