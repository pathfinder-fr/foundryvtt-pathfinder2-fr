Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>You've learned to bind some of your feathers together into a fan to focus your ancestral magic. You (and only you) can use the <em>tengu feather fan</em> to cast tengu magic. If your fan is lost or destroyed, you can create a replacement during your daily preparations; if you do so, your previous fan falls apart into mundane feathers. Further feats might grant you additional activations of your <em>tengu feather fan</em>, but you can never have more than three activations per day, no matter how many such feats you have. The DC for spells you cast with your <em>tengu feather fan</em> is your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>You can cast the 1st-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.g8QqHpv2CWDwmIm1]{Gust of Wind} spell by activating your <em>tengu feather fan</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong> Interact;</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> You cast one of the spells contained in your <em>tengu feather fan</em>. Activating the fan takes the spell's normal number of actions. You can also Activate the fan to cast a cantrip you've gained from a heritage or ancestry feat; this activation doesn't count against the fan's uses per day.</p>
