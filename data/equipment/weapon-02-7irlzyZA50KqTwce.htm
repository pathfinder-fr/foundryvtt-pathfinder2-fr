<p>Possessing a boisterous, proud demeanor, this <em>+1 jezail</em> is an aspiring big game hunter, always quick to share a tale of its bold adventures and predatory conquests-although the veracity of such tales is often questionable. A <em>boastful hunter</em> enjoys tracking and hunting animals of all kinds but takes particular pleasure in taking down large, dangerous, or rare animals. Against an animal, the <em>boastful hunter</em> deals [[/r {1d6}[additional]]]{1d6 additional damage}. On a critical hit against an animal, the <em>boastful hunter</em> also deals [[/r {1d6}[persistent,bleed]]]{1d6} @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Bleed Damage}.</p>
<p>A <em>boastful hunter</em> urges you to face off against tougher and tougher creatures-a challenge the ambitious rifle may not be adequate to deal with. If the <em>boastful hunter</em> goes one week without participating in a hunt against an animal of at least your level, it becomes bored. A bored <em>boastful hunter</em> complains incessantly and imposes a -1 item penalty to attack rolls against non-animal targets. A bored <em>boastful hunter</em> can be appeased by using it in combat against an animal of at least your level.</p>
<p>Unable to accept its own weaknesses, a <em>boastful hunter</em> blames any failed hunts on you, and considers remarks about its strength or quality a terrible insult. An insulted <em>boastful hunter</em> badmouths you to sentient creatures you interact with, imposing a -1 item penalty to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation skill checks, and all attacks with it incur a misfire chance until the weapon is appeased. An insulted <em>boastful hunter</em> can be appeased by complimenting it and succeeding at a <span data-pf2-check="diplomacy" data-pf2-label="Boastful Hunter Appeasement DC" data-pf2-dc="21" data-pf2-show-dc="gm">Diplomacy</span> check against its Will DC two days in a row. You can only attempt a Diplomacy check to appease the <em>boastful hunter</em> once each day.</p>
