------ Description (en) ------
<p>These ominous swords are decorated with crimson lacquer and serve as perfect conduits for the Crimson Oath's power. The first was granted to Clarethe Iomedar by a mysterious patron who many Reclaimers believe to be an emissary of Ragathiel.</p>
<p>A crimson brand is a +1 striking @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.fo6Yhq5mbQXsnZs0]{Wounding} bastard sword. When the wielder uses the crimson brand to cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.AsKLseOo8hwv5Jha]{Invoke the Crimson Oath}, they can generate a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone instead of the normal 20-foot cone.</p>
<p>Whenever the wielder would inflict persistent bleed damage on an undead creature with the <em>crimson brand</em>, they can instead wreathe the creature in ruby energy, inflicting the same amount of persistent positive damage instead of persistent bleed damage.</p>
