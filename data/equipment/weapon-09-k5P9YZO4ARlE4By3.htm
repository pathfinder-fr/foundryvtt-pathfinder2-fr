------ Description (en) ------
<p>These ominous swords are decorated with crimson lacquer and serve as perfect conduits for the Crimson Oath’s power. The first was granted to Clarethe Iomedar by a mysterious patron who many Reclaimers believe to be an emissary of Ragathiel.</p>
<p>A crimson brand is a +1 striking wounding bastard sword. When the wielder uses the crimson brand to cast <a class="entity-link" data-pack="pf2e.spells-srd" data-id="AsKLseOo8hwv5Jha" draggable="true"><i class="fas fa-suitcase"></i> Invoke the Crimson Oath</a>, they can generate a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone instead of the normal 20-foot cone.</p>
<p>Whenever the wielder would inflict persistent bleed damage on an undead creature with the <em>crimson brand</em>, they can instead wreathe the creature in ruby energy, inflicting the same amount of persistent positive damage instead of persistent bleed damage.</p>
