<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class="pf2-icon">d</span> Interact (emotion, enchantment, mental, visual);</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> You Stride. All creatures within 30 feet of you when you started the Stride must attempt a <span data-pf2-check="will" data-pf2-dc="35" data-pf2-traits="emotion,enchantment,mental,visual" data-pf2-label="Alluring Scarf (Major) DC" data-pf2-show-dc="gm">Will</span> save. On a failure, a creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AdPVz7rbaVSRxHFg]{Fascinated} and must spend at least one of its actions on its next turn to move toward you. A fascinated creature can attempt another Will save if you move more than 30 feet away from them, and as normal, acting hostile to a creature or its allies breaks fascination automatically. Creatures that critically failed their save don't receive further saves if you move more than 30 feet away, and acting hostile to such a creature's allies allows them to attempt another save, rather than automatically ending the fascination. You can Sustain the Activation for up to 1 minute.</p>
