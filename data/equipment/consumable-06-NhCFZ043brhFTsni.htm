<hr />
<p>This small figurine is carved from a single piece of silvery, spiky stone and resembles a beautiful dryad pouring water into a small pool. When you activate the muse, you are momentarily enlightened with inspiration that bolsters your performance. If you roll a success on your triggering check, you get a critical success instead.</p>
