<p>An <em>exploration lens</em> is a magical glass lens designed for a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.QrNvP9SgnK9DrerA]{Bull's Eye Lantern}. When light from the lantern passes through the lens, it alters the light to make it easier to perform a common exploration activity with the lantern.</p>
<p>Alternatively, an <em>exploration lens</em> can be installed in a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.gbwr57aT9ou8yKWT]{Wayfinder} like an aeon stone. In this case, light (such as that from a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.dIRZ0LL7G31fJNYz]{Lantern (Hooded)}, @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.8Jdw4yAzWYylGePS]{Torch}, or <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.WBmvzNDfpwka3qT4]{Light}</em> spell) must still pass through the lens and you must hold the wayfinder in your hand for it to function.</p>
<p>There are several different types of <em>exploration lens</em>, each granting benefits with a different type of exploration activity. Each type of lens is distinguishable from all the other types by holding it up to a bright light.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Type: Investigating</strong></p>
<p>The outer rim of this lens glows faintly when held up to the light.</p>
<p>While activated, the lens grants you a +1 item bonus to skill checks to Recall Knowledge while @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.EwgTZBWsc8qKaViP]{Investigating} by outlining potential clues in a way that triggers your memory.</p>
<p>If you're Investigating something while using the lens, you can always roll a Recall Knowledge skill check appropriate to the investigation for initiative.</p>
