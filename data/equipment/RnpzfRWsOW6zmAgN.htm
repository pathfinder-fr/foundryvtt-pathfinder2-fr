<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">This sinister-looking black statuette resembles a horse rearing up on its hind legs. When activated, this figurine becomes a nightmare. It can be called upon once per week for up to 24 hours, though it won’t use @Item[Plane Shift] or its other abilities on behalf of its rider. Although evil, it allows itself to be ridden by creatures of any alignment, although if a good creature mounts it, the rider must attempt a DC 3 flat check. On a failure, the nightmare uses <em>plane shift</em> to take the rider to a random location in the Abyss, where it promptly returns to statue form, stranding its rider in that nightmarish place.</span></p>
