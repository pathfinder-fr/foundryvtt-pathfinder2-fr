Because you’re not wielding the shield, you can’t use reactions such as Shield Block with&nbsp;the shield, but you gain its benefits even when using both of your hands. After 1 minute, the shield drops to the ground, ending its floating effect. While the shield is adjacent to you, you can Interact to grasp it, ending its floating effect early.</span></p>
