<hr>
<p>In Woodsedge Lodge, this thin red ribbon, typically worn around the neck, symbolizes the reach of Galt’s soul-trapping guillotines, the infamous final blades. Each of these talismans stores a specific disguise, chosen at the time of its creation. When activated, the talisman applies a disguise to its wearer, allowing them to Impersonate without taking the time to assemble a convincing disguise first. The components the disguise creates can appear to be worth up to 3 gp total.</p>
<p>The instant nature of the disguise leaves a few traces of its&nbsp; haphazard nature, imposing a –2 circumstance penalty on checks to Impersonate using the disguise.</p>
<p>Wearers with the <a class="entity-link" draggable="true" data-pack="pf2e.feats-srd" data-id="e4KB4pSkx2lDBNw3"><i class="fas fa-suitcase"></i> Quick Disguise</a> feat don’t take this penalty. Any objects created as a part of the disguise disappear after 24 hours or after you remove them.</p>
