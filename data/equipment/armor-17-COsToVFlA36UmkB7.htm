------ Description (en) ------
<p>This +2 greater resilient studded leather is traditionally inscribed with a symbol of either Norgorber or Cayden Cailean. Its leather is light as silk, and its buttons and studs are gleaming crystal. While you wear it, you get a +15-foot item bonus to your Speed, and effects that attempt to impose penalties on your Speed must first counteract the jerkin of liberation or they have no effect on you.</p>
<p>In addition, you are hard to incapacitate. You use the jerkin's item level or your own level, whichever is higher, to determine effects of the incapacitation trait.</p>
