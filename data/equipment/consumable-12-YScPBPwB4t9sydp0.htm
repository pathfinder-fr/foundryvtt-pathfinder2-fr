<p>This gummy resin contains sparkling motes of magical energy that dramatically impair your cognitive functions and dispel spells as you cast them. Spell energy manifests but then sputters out, as though drained away by the sparkling motes. While you're @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied} by this poison, the DC of flat checks to avoid disruption from the stupefied condition when you Cast a Spell is 5 + twice the stupefied value, rather than 5 + the stupefied value.</p>
