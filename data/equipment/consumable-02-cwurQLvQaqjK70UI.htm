------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Each feather token appears to be a simple feather from some exotic bird. The feather’s shaft, dipped in gold, bears a single arcane rune. Activating a feather token causes it to transform into another object, which then can be used as normal for that object. Each feather can be activated only once, with most of them permanently becoming the item in their description.<br></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput"><strong>Activate</strong> <img class="actiondark" style="height: 15px; padding: 0px 2px 0px 2px;" src="https://2e.aonprd.com/Images/Actions/OneAction.png" alt="Single Action"> Interact</span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">When this feather is activated, it immediately transforms into a living holly bush, filling a single square. This bush can provide standard cover. In addition, the bush has 2d4 bright-red berries. While holly berries are usually poisonous, these berries are infused with beneficial magic. You can pick and eat a berry as an Interact action to recover 1 Hit Point. Once plucked from the bush, a berry becomes non-magical after a few seconds, so it doesn’t heal you if you don’t eat it within the span of your Interact action.<br></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">If activated on soil, the plant continues to grow and thrive (although it doesn’t produce any more healing berries). If activated elsewhere, it withers and dies within 1d4 days.&nbsp;</span></p>
