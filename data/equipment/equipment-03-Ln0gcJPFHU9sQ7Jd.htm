<p>Diving suits are bulky, waterproofed leather outfits with copper helmets, worn by divers and underwater salvagers. The suit grants a +1 item bonus to Swim checks made underwater, and the helmet features tubes for connecting <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.7TQw7V1zZKl0a0Xz]{Bottled Air}</em>. When connected to a diving suit, <em>bottled air</em> doesn't need to be held and can be used to breathe as a free action. If you wear armor over a diving suit, you become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.i3OJZU2nk64Df3xm]{Clumsy 1} until you remove the diving suit.</p>
