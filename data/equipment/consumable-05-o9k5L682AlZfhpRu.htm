<p>This bright oil, first created by humans as a tool to help them fight in darkness, holds flecks of tiny gemstones in suspension and smells like a struck <em>tindertwig</em>.</p>
<p>The first time a weapon coated with this oil damages a creature, the wound glows with light for 1 minute. If the creature is <em>invisible</em>, the light's position means it is merely <em>hidden </em>to creatures that would otherwise be unable to see it, rather than <em>undetected</em>. The light also negates the <em>concealed </em>condition due to lighting conditions. If the coated weapon doesn't damage a creature within 1 hour, the oil sloughs off and loses its power.</p>
