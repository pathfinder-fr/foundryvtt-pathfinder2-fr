<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Finely carved from a solid piece of marble, this gleaming elephant statuette becomes a fully grown elephant when activated. The elephant can be called upon no more than four times per month. It remains for 24 hours as long as it is being used as a beast of burden or for transport. If it attempts an attack or otherwise engages in combat, it reverts to statuette form after 1d4 rounds.</span></p>
