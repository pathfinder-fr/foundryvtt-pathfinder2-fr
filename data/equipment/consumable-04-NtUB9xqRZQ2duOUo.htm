<p>Small flecks of mica, sand, and ground glass are packed into a spring-loaded canister that can be rigged to a trip wire or hidden in a container. The first creature to enter the square or open the container must attempt a <span data-pf2-check="reflex" data-pf2-traits="uncommon,consumable,mechanical,snare,trap,visual" data-pf2-label="Glittering Snare DC" data-pf2-dc="20" data-pf2-show-dc="all">Reflex</span> save as the area is showered with bright, glittering dust that sticks to skin, fur, and clothing.</p>

<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes a -1 status penalty to Stealth checks for 1 minute or until it uses an Interact action to remove the glitter.</p>
<p>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-effects.w0LUnfS2whVhDBUF]{Effect: Glittering Snare (Success)}</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes a -2 status penalty to Stealth checks for 2 minutes or until it spends a 2-action activity, which has the manipulate trait, to remove the glitter. If the creature was @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible}, the glitter outlines it for 1 round, making it @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} rather than @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected} to visual senses.</p>

<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the penalty is -4. The glitter sticks for 5 minutes or until the creature spends a 3-action activity, which has the manipulate trait, to remove it. The glitter continues to fall around the creature until completely removed, leaving a trail behind it as it moves and revealing its rough location; the creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden}, rather than undetected, to any creature that can see the glitter whenever it would otherwise have been undetected.</p>
