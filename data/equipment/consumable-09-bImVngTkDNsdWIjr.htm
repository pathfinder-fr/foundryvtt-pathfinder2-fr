<p>Activating this black powder-infused alchemical bandage cauterizes wounds. You can apply a searing suture to yourself or an adjacent willing creature as you activate it. The target creature takes [[/r {1d6}[fire]]]{1d6 fire damage} and can immediately attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] to remove the persistent bleed damage. When applied against a bleed effect that is lower level than the searing suture, the flat check is automatically successful.</p>
