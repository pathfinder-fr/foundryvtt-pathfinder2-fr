<p>An <em>exploration lens</em> is a magical glass lens designed for a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.QrNvP9SgnK9DrerA]{Bull's Eye Lantern}. When light from the lantern passes through the lens, it alters the light to make it easier to perform a common exploration activity with the lantern.</p>
<p>Alternatively, an <em>exploration lens</em> can be installed in a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.gbwr57aT9ou8yKWT]{Wayfinder} like an aeon stone. In this case, light (such as that from a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.dIRZ0LL7G31fJNYz]{Lantern (Hooded)}, @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.8Jdw4yAzWYylGePS]{Torch}, or <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.WBmvzNDfpwka3qT4]{Light}</em> spell) must still pass through the lens and you must hold the wayfinder in your hand for it to function.</p>
<p>There are several different types of <em>exploration lens</em>, each granting benefits with a different type of exploration activity. Each type of lens is distinguishable from all the other types by holding it up to a bright light.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Type: Searching</strong></p>
<p>This lens has an opalescent sheen when held up to light.</p>
<p>The lens subtly outlines hidden doors and concealed hazards, granting you a +2 item bonus to Perception checks to spot such features while @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.TiNDYUGlMmxzxBYU]{Searching}.</p>
<p>Even if you aren't Searching, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to Search.</p>
