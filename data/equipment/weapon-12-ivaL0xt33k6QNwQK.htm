<hr>
<p>This flask holds a pressurized red-brown gas flecked with bits of sublimated crystal. You gain a +2 item bonus to attack rolls. When the bomb explodes, it deals [[/r 3d4 #piercing]] piercing damage and [[/r 5 #piercing splash]] piercing splash damage as the mixture suddenly turns into solid crystals flying at high speeds.</p>
<p>Surfaces in the splash area grow brittle, gleaming red crystals that crumble to dust after 1 minute. The crystals on level surfaces are @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.7fSnvJ2xoSfa6JXD]{Caltrops} (Core Rulebook 287). The crystals on vertical surfaces can be used briefly as handholds, granting the listed item bonus to the next Athletics check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb} each space. The crystals in each space crumble after the creature leaves, whether Climbing or moving through the caltrops.</p>
