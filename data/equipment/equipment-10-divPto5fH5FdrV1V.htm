------ Description (en) ------
<p>The dwarven gunsmiths of Dongun Hold originally created these scopes to help them clear out vermin in underground areas. This scope captures the sound that echoes off a creature hit by the firearm and transforms it into light, illuminating the target for all to see.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class="pf2-icon">1</span> Interact (auditory, light, transmutation);</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> If your next Strike from the weapon to which the scope is attached hits a creature, the sound of the impact transforms into light, causing the creature to glow until the end of your next turn. A visible creature can't be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} while they glow. If a creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible}, they're concealed while glowing, rather than being undetected. Because the effect requires a solid impact, incorporeal creatures are unaffected unless the bullet can deal force damage or has the effects of the ghost touch property rune.</p>
