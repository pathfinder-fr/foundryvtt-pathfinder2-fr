<p>This bronze, spherical device slowly rotates around a cluster of angled mirrors and a light-filled orb. When you activate the viewfinder, it spins rapidly and reflects light into the orb at the center. This reveals the area around you up to 30 feet in a burst of light, including objects and areas that aren't in your line of sight. This doesn't grant you any additional information that couldn't otherwise be gathered by your senses.</p>
