Name: Taljjae's Mask (The Wanderer)
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Those who gain one of Taljjae's masks, either by defeating Taljjae or some other means, are known as its understudies and gain a fraction of its power. Each of Taljjae's masks is an 18th-level unique item with the invested and magical traits; if broken, they're automatically repaired to full HP when invested during daily preparations. The effect of a mask on a PC is noted in the mask's Understudy entry. Wearing one of Taljjae's masks also imposes Taljjae's jelly sense and jelly gluttony on the creature as long as it wears the mask.</p>
<p>The <em>Wanderer</em> allows its wearer to cast 7th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.b5sGjGlBf58f8jn0]{Air Walk}</em> and 8th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.aqRYNoSvxsVfqglH]{Freedom of Movement}</em>, each as a divine innate spell, once per day.</p>
