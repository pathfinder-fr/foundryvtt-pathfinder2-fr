------ Description (en) ------
<p>This flintlock pistol has two side-by-side barrels. Though less accurate than a standard pistol, a double-barreled pistol is a useful and versatile weapon. It's generally banned in areas where duels with pistols are relatively common, in much the same way that arriving at an aristocratic duel with a scattergun would be considered crass, at best.</p>
