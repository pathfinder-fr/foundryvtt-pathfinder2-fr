<p>This yellow fruit's soft flesh is covered by waxy, fibrous leaves reminiscent of a pineapple. When you eat an apricot of bestial might, you transform into a boar-faced battle form with scaly skin. You can use feats with this item as if it were a bestial mutagen, improving your tusk unarmed attack as if it were a claw or jaws attack.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong> You gain 8 resistance to all physical damage and gain a tusk unarmed attack with the deadly d12 trait that deals 1d10 piercing damage.</p>
<p><strong>Drawback</strong> You become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.i3OJZU2nk64Df3xm]{Clumsy 1}. If you perform an action with the auditory or linguistic traits, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is lost.</p>
