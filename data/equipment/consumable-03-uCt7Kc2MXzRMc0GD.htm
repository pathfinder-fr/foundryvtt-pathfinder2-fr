<p>Performers popularized these bundles of aromatic herbs to calm the mind and ward off misfortune before a big show, though soldier bards have found them especially useful for clearing fear during particularly tumultuous battles. Adding this catalyst to a @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.szIyEsvihc5e1w8n]{Soothe} spell also causes the spell to reduce the target's @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened} condition value by 1.</p>
