------ Description (en) ------
<p>Clockwork timepieces come in a variety of sizes and aesthetic styles, but they're all designed to display the accurate time of day down to the second.</p>
<p>Clockwork timepieces have a 24-hour activation cycle, after which they must wound in a process that takes 1 minute to complete.</p>
<p>Desktop clocks have been designed to be small enough to only take up a quarter of a typical writing desk's surface area, but they're still too bulky and heavy to be lugged around casually.</p>
