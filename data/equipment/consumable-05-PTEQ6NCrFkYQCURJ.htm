------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class="pf2-icon">1</span> Strike</p>
<p>This crystal vial contains salts blessed by channeling life-giving energies into waters purified by holy fire. You can activate this vial by throwing it as a Strike. It's a simple thrown ranged weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the manipulate trait to the attack made with it. On a hit against an undead, <em>life salt</em> deals 1 persistent positive damage, and the undead must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:20] or be unable to attack you as long as it continues taking the persistent positive damage. If you use a hostile action against any undead, this second effect ends, and the undead can attack you normally.</p>
