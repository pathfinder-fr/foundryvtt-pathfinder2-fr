<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> bolt</p>
<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class="pf2-icon">1</span> Interact</p>
<hr />
<p>The head of this bolt is a vented container that smells strongly of caustic pepper. When an activated blindpepper bolt hits a target, it deals no damage; instead the creature must attempt a <span data-pf2-check="fortitude" data-pf2-traits="ammunition,magical,consumable" data-pf2-label="Blindpepper Bolt DC" data-pf2-dc="17" data-pf2-show-dc="all">Fortitude</span> save. If the Strike was a critical success, the target takes a -2 circumstance penalty to its Fortitude save. At the GM's discretion, a creature with no eyes or olfactory organs might not be affected by this item.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} until the end of your next turn. It can end the effect early if it spends an action, which has the manipulate trait, to wipe down its eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is dazzled for 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} until the end of your next turn and dazzled for 1 minute.</p>
