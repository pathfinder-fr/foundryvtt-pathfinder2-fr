Name: Reaper's Lancet Sheath
Nom: 
État: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Hendrid Pratchett himself designed this custom skull-topped +1 striking exquisite sword cane and had it gilded in high-quality gold. Its first victim was the very smith whom Pratchett commissioned to craft the weapon, so the means of its construction are a secret known only to Pratchett. The magic of the Reaper's Lancet applies to both the blade and the sheath, making them each effectively a +1 striking weapon, but only if both are wielded by the same creature—if the two components are shared between creatures, only the blade retains the rune's magic.</p>
