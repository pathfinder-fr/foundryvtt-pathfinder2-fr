<p>This frothing fluid causes the drinker's body to exude trace odor absorbing oils. For 10 minutes after drinking this elixir, your scent is nearly unnoticeable.</p>
<p>Creatures with imprecise scent don't detect you with that sense unless they <a class="entity-link" data-pack="pf2e.actionspf2e" data-id="BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ" draggable="true"><i class="fas fa-suitcase"></i> Seek</a> for you, and you are concealed from creatures that perceive you with precise scent. You gain a +4 item bonus against attempts to Seek you by creatures using only scent-based senses; if they use any other senses as well, the bonus doesn't apply.</p>
