<p>This frothing fluid causes the drinker&rsquo;s body to exude trace odorabsorbing oils. For the listed duration after drinking this elixir, your scent is nearly unnoticeable. Creatures with imprecise scent don&rsquo;t detect you with that sense unless they @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} for you, and you are concealed from creatures that perceive you with precise scent. You gain a +4 item bonus against attempts to Seek you by creatures using only scent-based senses; if they use any other senses as well, the bonus doesn&rsquo;t apply.</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes.</p>
