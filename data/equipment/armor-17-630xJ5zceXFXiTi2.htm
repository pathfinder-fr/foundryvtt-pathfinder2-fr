<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class="pf2-icon">D</span> command, Interact</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> You surround yourself in a coruscating field of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet light for 1 minute. Each color has a different effect, based on the effects of a 7th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.forsqeofEszBNtLq]{Chromatic Wall}</em> spell, and you apply the effects of each color once before it disappears from your field of light, which can happen in the following two ways.</p>
<p>First, the field attempts a counteract check (counteract level 7, counteract modifier [[/r 1d20+27 #Counteract]]{+27}) against any effect that would be blocked by a chromatic wall of any of the colors still surrounding you in your field of light. Succeed or fail, that color then disappears from your field of light.</p>
<p>Second, any creature that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon is affected by a random remaining color from your field. As normal, this doesn’t affect creatures you choose to touch.</p>
<p>A creature can also remove a color from your field of light by using a specific spell, as described in <em>chromatic wall</em>. The effect ends early if each color disappears from your field of light, or if you choose to Dismiss it.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> The initial raw materials must include 1,600 gp of mithral.</p>
