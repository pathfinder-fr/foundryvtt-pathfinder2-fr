------ Description (en) ------
<p>This seemingly unremarkable, weathered silver coin bears the bust of an unnamed monarch on the face and a majestic bird on the tail. You can toss the coin without activating it, in which case it follows the normal laws of probability.</p>
<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span style="font-family: 'Pathfinder2eActions'; font-size: 1.8em; display: inline;">1</span> Interact;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> You rub your thumb on one side of the coin with the intent of slightly tweaking the strands of fate, then flip the coin into the air in a coin toss. No matter how the toss is resolved- letting the coin fall to the ground, slapping it down on the back of your hand, or catching it on your open palm-it always lands with the side you rubbed face up.</p>
