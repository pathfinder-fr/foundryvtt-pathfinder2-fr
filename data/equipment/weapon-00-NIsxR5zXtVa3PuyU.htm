------ Description (en) ------
<p><span class="fontstyle0">This heavy blade is favored by guardians of religious sites. It has a distinctive, crescent‑shaped blade that seems to be a mix of a sickle and sword. It often has holes drilled into the blade or the pommel so that bells or other holy trinkets can be affixed to the weapon as an aid for prayer or mediation.</span></p>
