<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong> Interact <span class="pf2-icon">2</span></p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The horn is clearly audible for hundreds of feet, but within a @Template[type:emanation|distance:20], the sound causes agony in those who wish harm upon the user; the horn also sheds bright light in that area and dim light to the next 20 feet. Enemies of the user in this area take [[/r {7d6}[sonic]]]{7d6 sonic damage} and [[/r {7d6}[good]]]{7d6 good damage} (basic @Check[type:fortitude|dc:30] save). Creatures that are specifically vulnerable to sunlight are also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 1} if they fail this save or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2} on a critical failure. This activation also attempts to counteract any darkness or sleep effects in the area ([[/r 1d20+23 #Counteract]]{+23} counteract check).</p>
