<p>This small, fragile tusk came from a very young mammoth. It's filled with ice-cold glacial water and capped with a carved piece of ivory. When you crush the tusk, the water rushes around you in an instant as you twist away from impending disaster with a supernatural flourish. You teleport to an unoccupied space within 200 feet that you can see, bringing along all your equipment. You can't bring any other creature with you, even in an extradimensional space.</p>
