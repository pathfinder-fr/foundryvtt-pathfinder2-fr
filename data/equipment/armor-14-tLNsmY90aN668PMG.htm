------ Description (en) ------
<p>This elegant full plate is embossed with heraldic imagery and never tarnishes or loses its shine. <em>Glorious plate</em> is <em>+2 resilient full plate</em>.</p>
<p>In battle, <em>glorious plate</em> sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius, which enemies see as a blinding halo that obscures creatures other than the wearer. When an enemy looks at the wearer, it must attempt a DC 33 Will saving throw. The enemy is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The enemy is unaffected.<br /><strong>Failure</strong> For 1 minute, the wearer's allies within the glorious plate's 10-foot radius of light are concealed to the enemy. Allies are concealed only while they remain within the light; if allies enter the light later, they are concealed as well.<br /><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except the wearer's allies are hidden to the enemy instead of concealed.</p>
