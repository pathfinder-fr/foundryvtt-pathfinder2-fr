<p>This arrow is made of polished animal horn, with the head of a rhinoceros carved in place of a traditional arrowhead. When an activated rhino shot is fired, the ethereal form of a large rhinoceros takes shape around the projectile. On a successful Strike, the attack deals an additional 2d6 force damage, and the target must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be knocked @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone}. If the hit with the <em>rhino shot</em> was a critical success, the target is knocked prone unless it critically succeeds at its save.</p>
