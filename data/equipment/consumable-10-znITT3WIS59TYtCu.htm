------ Description (en) ------
<p>Carried by many Knights of Lastwall, this amber-colored, fragrant-smelling oil is meant to prevent those who fall in battle from rising as undead. Applying <em>anointing oil</em> to a corpse casts a 5th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.xRgU9rrhmGAgG4Rc]{Gentle Repose}</em> on it. The effects last for 24 hours. The funerary rites of the Knights of Lastwall sometimes include using this type of oil on their dead if they are to be buried.</p>
<p>The oil is repugnant to the undead. An undead creature that touches a corpse treated with this oil is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled 1} until the contact is broken or the oil's effect wears off.</p>
