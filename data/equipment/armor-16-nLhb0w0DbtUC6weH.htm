------ Description (en) ------
<p>Based on the armors used by the holy warriors who served under General Arnisant in the Shining Crusade, this well-polished <em>+2 greater resilient half plate</em> is decorated with religious motifs and carved with sacred scripture. While wearing armor of the holy warrior, your item bonus from the <em>greater resilient rune</em> increases from +2 to +3; if you upgrade to a <em>major resilient rune</em>, the item bonus instead increases from +3 to +4. An undead that critically fails an unarmed attack against you while you wear this armor takes 1d6 positive damage.</p>
<p>If you are evil, you're @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled 2} while wearing the armor. If you're undead, you also take [[/r {2d6}[positive]]]{2d6 positive damage} each round that you wear the armor.</p>
