------ Description (en) ------
<p>This brown leather satchel is made from a heavily oiled and rustic leather. The satchel is large enough to hold up to 1 Bulk worth of items.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong> 1 minute (envision, Interact);</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> Documents inside the haversack become magically disguised as documents of a similar type but with misleading information. Anyone inspecting a document notices the disguise with a successful <span data-pf2-check="perception" data-pf2-label="Determine Documents are Misleading DC" data-pf2-dc="20" data-pf2-show-dc="all">Perception</span> check, but determining the actual text requires a successful <span data-pf2-check="society" data-pf2-traits="action:decipher-writing" data-pf2-label="Decipher Writing DC" data-pf2-dc="20" data-pf2-show-dc="all">Society</span> check to Decipher Writing. This lasts until you use this activation again, which ends the effect for all previously disguised documents; until you use the second activation to end the effect for a single document; or until a document in the haversack remains outside the haversack for at least 1 hour, ending the effect for that document.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class="pf2-icon">1</span> command;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> You revert one of the documents back to its original state.</p>
