<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">This cloak is deep green with a voluminous hood, embroidered with gold trim and symbols significant in elven culture. The cloak allows you to cast the @Item[Ghost Sound] cantrip as an arcane innate spell. When you adjust the cloak’s clasp (an Interact action), the cloak transforms to match the environment around you and muffles your sounds, granting you a +2 item bonus to Stealth checks.<br></span></p>
