------ Description (en) ------
<p>Neither mithral nor a tree, this long gun takes its name from the legends of the elves of Jinin and is most commonly found within the nation. An elegant weapon, a mithral tree does somewhat resemble a tree; its fanned stock and long, sweeping barrel reinforced with metal rings enable a wielder to parry melee attacks while moving back into safe firing range.</p>
