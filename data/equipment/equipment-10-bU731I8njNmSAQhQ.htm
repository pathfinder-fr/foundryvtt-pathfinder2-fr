------ Description (en) ------
<p>This ornate pendant of brass is adorned with a vibrant blue gemstone. An <em>aluum charm</em> grants control over a particular aluum and&nbsp;lesser influence over other such constructs. As long as you wear an aluum’s linked <em>aluum charm</em>, that aluum follows your verbal commands, including somewhat nuanced orders like “subdue this target” or “strike anyone wearing a blue robe.”</p>

<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span style="font-family: 'Pathfinder2eActions'; font-size: 1.8em; display: inline;">D</span> command</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The charm grants you control over an aluum you can see within 60 feet, with a level equal to or lower than the charm. This has the effect of @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.OsOhx3TGIZ7AhD0P]{Dominate} and allows a DC 28 Will save. If the aluum is currently under the control of someone wearing its linked charm, it gets a result on its saving throw one degree higher than what it rolled.</p>
<p>You can control only one aluum at a time using this activation, and controlling a new aluum ends the effect for one you had previously affected.</p>
