------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">This ornate pendant of brass is adorned with a vibrant blue gemstone. An <em>aluum charm</em> grants control over a particular aluum and&nbsp;lesser influence over other such constructs. As long as you wear an aluum’s linked <em>aluum charm</em>, that aluum follows your verbal commands, including somewhat nuanced orders like “subdue this target” or “strike anyone wearing a blue robe.”<br></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput"><strong>Activate</strong> <img class="actiondark" style="height: 15px; padding: 0px 2px 0px 2px;" src="https://2e.aonprd.com/Images/Actions/TwoActions.png" alt="Two Actions"> command; <strong>Frequency</strong> once per round; <strong>Effect</strong> The charm grants you control over an aluum you can see within 60 feet, with a level equal to or lower than the charm. This has the effect of dominate and allows a DC 28 Will save. If the aluum is currently under the control of someone wearing its linked charm, it gets a result on its saving throw one degree higher than what it rolled. You can control only one aluum at a time using this activation, and controlling a new aluum ends the effect for one you had previously affected.</span></p>
