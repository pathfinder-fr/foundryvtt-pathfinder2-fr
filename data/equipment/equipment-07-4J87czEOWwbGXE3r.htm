------ Description (en) ------
<p>This subtle pattern of complex dots, sunbursts, and lines is difficult to make out, as it's a near match for the wearer's skin tone. Serving as a barrier facing inward, this tattoo prevents ostentatious expressions of spells that are internal to you, making them easier to hide.</p>

<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class="pf2-icon">1</span> Interact (concentrate, manipulate, metamagic);</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell of 2nd level or lower that affects or targets only you, you can hide that you're casting it. This has the same effect as the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.sIeuPW0j39fTZm08]{Conceal Spell} feat.</p>
