------ Description (en) ------
<p>These boots act as greater boots of elvenkind, but they react wildly to strong physical exertion. While you wear the boots, the curse activates whenever you attempt an Athletics check or Stride more than once in a single round during an encounter. The boots cast an 8th-level uncontrollable dance spell on you, and you automatically fail your save. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the boots fuse to you.&nbsp;</p>
