After you drink this mutagen, your body becomes thick and sturdy. You exhibit a healthy glow, though you tend to be ponderous and unobservant. The bonus is +3, you gain 30 temporary Hit Points, and the duration is 1 hour. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.
