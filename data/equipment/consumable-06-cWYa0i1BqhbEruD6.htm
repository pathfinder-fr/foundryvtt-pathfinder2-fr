<p>When you use a dose of addiction suppressant, it suppresses the effects of that addiction for 1 day, as if you had taken an actual dose of the drug but without any of the drug's effects, and it doesn't increase the addiction DC. You also gain a +2 item bonus against the ongoing save against the drug's addiction depending on the type of addiction suppressant.<br /><br />For every drug, a specific suppressant must be crafted- no generalized addiction suppressant yet exists. In order to create an addiction suppressant, you must begin with a dose of the drug to be suppressed, then use alchemical reagents to generate an elixir that can be used to fight that drug's addiction. An addiction suppressant must be a higher level than the drug it is meant to suppress in order to work.</p>
