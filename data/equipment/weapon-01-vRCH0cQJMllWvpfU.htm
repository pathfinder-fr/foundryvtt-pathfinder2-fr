------ Description (en) ------
<p><span>The polytool is a small metal rod with a number of simple tools folded inside. The user can extend a long ceramic blade, as well as an awl, a chisel, a file, flint and steel, a hook, an inkpen, a magnifying glass, pliers, scissors, and a small saw. The flint and steel can be used up to 10 times before needing to be replaced. Though inspired by advanced Numerian technology, the polytool is a simple enough feat of metalworking that any blacksmith could produce it— perfect for the goddess @Compendium[pf2e.deities.soiVh53y9RAeSLEk]{Casandalee} to spread innovation farther than actual Numerian tech could reach.&nbsp;</span></p>
