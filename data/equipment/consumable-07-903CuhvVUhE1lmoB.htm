<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span style="font-family: 'Pathfinder2eActions'; font-size: 1.8em; display: inline;">1</span> Interact</p>
<p>This peculiar ammunition is coated in yellow dust that leaves a stain on anything it touches. When activated corrosive ammunition hits a target, it dissolves across the target's armor. The armor takes 1d8 persistent acid damage that ignores the armor's Hardness; if the target isn't wearing armor, it takes the acid damage instead. This damage occurs at the end of the target's turns.</p>
<p>The creature can end this effect by spending an Interact action to wipe off the corrosive dust, and otherwise the effect ends once the armor becomes broken.</p>
