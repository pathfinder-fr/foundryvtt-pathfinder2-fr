------ Description (en) ------
<p>This pale gemstone grants its wearer a +2 item bonus to saving throws and the ability to discern a target's alignment (as detect alignment, but can detect chaotic, evil, good, and lawful auras simultaneously) at will by peering through the gemstone.</p>
<p>Like all hag <em>heartstones</em>, this gemstone is powered by Skarja's spirit. Skarja does not need to wear her <em>heartstone</em> to benefit from its powers, but she cannot use them if she hasn't touched her <em>heartstone</em> in the past 7 days. If Skarja's <em>heartstone</em> is separated from her for more than 7 days (or if she's been dead for 7 days), it becomes a non-magical gemstone. Skarja's <em>heartstone</em> allows her to use additional occult innate spells: @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.D2nPKbIS67m9199U]{Ethereal Jaunt} (9th level) and @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.GYmXvS9NJ7QwfWGg]{Bind Soul} at will, @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.IqJ9URobmJ9L9UBG]{Shadow Blast} (6th level) twice per day, and @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.PHVHBbdHeQRfjLmE]{Spirit Blast} once per day.</p>
