Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p><span>This ring seems like simple tarnished brass, but it enhances your curiosity about traps and devices of all kinds. You can use an Interact action to pull a set of thieves' tools from the ring. These tools appear in your hand and fold back into the ring if they would leave your possession. They grant you a +3 item bonus to Thievery checks to Disable a Device and to Pick a Lock, and the ring's insights grant you the same bonus to Crafting checks to Craft and Repair snares and traps.<br></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Activate</strong> 10 minutes (Interact); <strong>Frequency</strong> once per day; <strong>Effect</strong> You create a 8th-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.o0l57UfBm9ScEUMW]{Glyph of Warding} containing </span>your choice of either @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.d6o52BnjViNz7Gub]{Prismatic Spray} or 7th-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.sxQZ6yqTn0czJxVd]{Fireball}. You can have only one <em>glyph of warding</em> from a <em>ring of maniacal devices</em> active at a time, even if you have multiple rings, and the spell ends if you lose your investiture in the ring.</p>
