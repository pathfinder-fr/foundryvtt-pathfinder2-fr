Name: Ring of Manical Devices (Greater)
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>This ring seems like simple tarnished brass, but it enhances your curiosity about traps and devices of all kinds.</p>
<p>You can use an Interact action to pull a set of thieves' tools from the ring. These tools appear in your hand and fold back into the ring if they would leave your possession.</p>
<p>They grant you a +3 item bonus to Thievery checks to Disable a Device and to Pick a Lock, and the ring's insights grant you the same bonus to Crafting checks to Craft and Repair snares and traps.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong> 10 minutes (Interact)</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> You create a 8th-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.o0l57UfBm9ScEUMW]{Glyph of Warding} containing your choice of either @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.d6o52BnjViNz7Gub]{Prismatic Spray} or 7th-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.sxQZ6yqTn0czJxVd]{Fireball}.</p>
