------ Description (en) ------
<p>Pathfinder Society researchers recently created elemental wayfinders with the assistance of the Society's elemental allies. In addition to the effects of a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.gbwr57aT9ou8yKWT]{Wayfinder}, these wayfinders each grant the ability to cast a particular elemental spell once per day, and can assist Pathfinders in exploring areas associated with their element. Each has the trait associated with its element.</p>
