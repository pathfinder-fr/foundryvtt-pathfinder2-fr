------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">This circular hoop has blades along its outer edge. You can wield it in two hands (using the two-hand damage) or by spinning it around an arm. While you spin the hoop, it gains the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=181">free-hand</a> trait. Setting the hoop spinning takes 1 Interact action. In addition to the normal restrictions of the free-hand trait, extended use of the arm for locomotion (such as to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb}) interferes with the hoop’s spinning and forces you to Release the hoop. You can’t spin a hoop underwater. Keeping the hoop spinning requires a free action each round, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits. You can keep a hoop spinning as an exploration activity, but doing so for more than 10 minutes makes you fatigued, similarly to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.JuqmIAnkL9hVGai8]{Hustle}.&nbsp;</span></p>
