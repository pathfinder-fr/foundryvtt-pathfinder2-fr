------ Description (en) ------
<p>This extremely fetching oversized compass has numerous extraneous gears, levers, doodads, and buttons. It does not function as a compass. Instead, it always points to the nearest wayfinder. An indentation in the middle of the wayfinderfinder can hold a single wayfinder. A wayfinder stored in this manner-and any aeon stone it may contain-provides no benefits, but the wayfinderfinder points to the nearest wayfinder of the type stored within, instead of any wayfinder. If you have more than one wayfinderfinder holding a wayfinder on your person at a given time, the wayfinderfinders point to each other instead, and any aeon stones in your possession begin annoyingly bouncing off your head instead of rotating around it.</p>

<p><strong>Effect</strong> The wayfinderfinder shouts "Explore! Report! Cooperate!" then rapidly explains that certain uses of the wayfinderfinder may void its warranty.</p>
