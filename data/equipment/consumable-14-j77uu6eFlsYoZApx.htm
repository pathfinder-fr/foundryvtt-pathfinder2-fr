------ Description (en) ------
<p>The frayed threads from the rips and tears in <em>Hao Jin's Tapestry</em> still contain traces of the Ruby Phoenix's magic. Hao Jin has collected most of these loose strings, but others occasionally find these potent silk strands in unexpected places. A ruby string can fulfill the cost requirement for an 8th-level <em>create demiplane</em> ritual. When used in this way, the ruby string negates the need for secondary casters, and you get a success for all secondary checks. Alternatively, you can activate it to create a smaller demiplane without requiring the ritual.</p>
<p><strong>Activate</strong> 8 hours (envision, Interact);</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> You spin the thread to form a demiplane with the effects of a successful 8th-level <em>create demiplane</em>, but the space is a single 10-foot cube.</p>
