<p>When you put on this mask, for the next hour, you can hold your breath for 15 rounds plus your Constitution modifier (instead of 5 rounds + your Constitution modifier) before drowning. It has no effect in non‑aquatic environments that require you to hold your breath. One hour after you apply the mask, it flakes away into fiber shreds.</p>
