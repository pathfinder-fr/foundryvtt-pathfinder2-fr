<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">This statuette depicts a pair of gold lions, and when activated, it becomes a pair of adult lions. The lions can be called on only once per day, and they remain in lion form for no more than 1 hour. If either of the lions is slain, that lion cannot be summoned again until 1 week has passed, but this doesn&rsquo;t prevent you from summoning the other.</span></p>
