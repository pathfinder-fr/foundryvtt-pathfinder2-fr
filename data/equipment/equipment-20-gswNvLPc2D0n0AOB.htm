------ Description (en) ------
<p>This brilliant jewelry is made from fine silver interwoven with a uniquely malleable form of ruby that causes the necklace to glimmer like a flickering fire. Hao Jin created the necklaces to mitigate the potential of death during the Ruby Phoenix Tournament pre-qualifier, and she specially attuned each phoenix necklace to the silver feathers she created for the pre-qualifying round. While the silver feathers themselves aren't magical, they are required to activate the necklace's power. Each team starts with 3 feathers hidden in their headquarters; they acquire more through challenges and events. Additionally, the tournament emissary's enforcers have the ability to deliver messages to the necklace's wearer at any time by casting @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.R9xqCBblkS5KE4y7]{Sending}, though the wearer can't respond.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class="pf2-icon">3</span> command, envision;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> You select any number of willing creatures you can see within 30 feet, including yourself. The selected creatures can make nonlethal attacks without taking a penalty to their attack rolls. This effect remains in place until you remove the necklace or use this activation again.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong> 10 minutes (envision, Interact);</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The necklace consumes one of the attached silver feathers and casts 7th-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.IkGYwHRLhkuoGReG]{Raise Dead}. Activating this ability is particularly costly and every activation requires consuming one more silver feather than the previous activation.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Destruction</strong> Once a phoenix necklace has 10 silver feathers attached, Hao Jin can transform the necklace into a phoenix fighting fan, a process which requires 3 Interact actions.</p>
