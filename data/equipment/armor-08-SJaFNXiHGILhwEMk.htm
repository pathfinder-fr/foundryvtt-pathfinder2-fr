------ Description (en) ------

<p><strong>Effect</strong> You animate the silkspinner’s shield. Eight spider legs sprout from the shield's rim, granting you a climb Speed of 25 feet until the end of your next turn. Additionally, the spinnerets animate and produce silk for 1 minute. Successful shield bash Strikes made with the silkspinner's shield during this time entangle the target in silk. The target takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. If your Strike was a critical hit, the target becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} for 1 round instead. Regardless, the target can attempt to Escape (DC 30) to end the effect early.</p>
