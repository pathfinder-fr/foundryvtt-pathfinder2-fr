------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">This dark iron door knocker comes in a variety of shapes, such as a bird clutching a ring in its talons or a gargoyle holding a ring in its mouth. Placing the door knocker on the surface of a door (an Interact action) causes it to attach and remain in place. While in place, the door knocker whispers hints to you while you attempt to unlock the door, granting a +1 item bonus to Thievery checks to Pick a Lock. Removing the door knocker from a surface requires you to use an Interact action.<br /></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput"><strong>Activate</strong> <img class="actiondark" style="height: 15px; padding: 0px 2px 0px 2px;" src="https://2e.aonprd.com/Images/Actions/TwoActions.png" alt="Two Actions" /> command, Interact; <strong>Frequency</strong> once per day; <strong>Effect</strong> You place the door knocker against a wall, floor, or ceiling. The door knocker fuses in place and creates a usable door within the surface. Any creature can move through the door normally, as if the door had always been there. The door can penetrate up to 1 foot of material, so thick material, such as heavy stone walls, can cause this effect to fail, expending its use for the day. A thin layer of metal in a wall, floor, or ceiling also causes the effect to fail. You can use an Interact action to release the door knocker from the surface and return the surface to its previous shape.</span></p>
