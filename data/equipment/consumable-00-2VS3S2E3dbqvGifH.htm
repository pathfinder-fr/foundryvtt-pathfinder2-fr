Name: Fake Blood Pack

------ Description (en) ------
<p>Adventurers have found a number of uses for these animal blood-filled bladders, which were originally used in theatrical productions. Whenever you take slashing or piercing damage with the fake blood pack under your clothes or armor, roll a DC 11 flat check. On a success, the blood pack is punctured. You or an ally can puncture the hidden pack intentionally.</p>
<p>When faking an injury, the blood pack grants a +2 item bonus to relevant Deception checks, such as to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.ewwCglB7XOPLUz72]{Lie} about being injured. Abilities that trigger when a creature deals bleed damage, determine if a creature is bleeding, or are otherwise based on bleed damage don't trigger or apply for blood from a fake blood pack, which might mean creatures with such abilities automatically realize the ruse.</p>
