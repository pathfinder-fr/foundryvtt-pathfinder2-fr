------ Description (en) ------
After you drink this mutagen, your body becomes thick and sturdy. You exhibit a healthy glow, though you tend to be ponderous and unobservant. The bonus is +4, you gain 45 temporary Hit Points, and the duration is 1 hour. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead, and your critical failures on Fortitude saves become failures instead.
