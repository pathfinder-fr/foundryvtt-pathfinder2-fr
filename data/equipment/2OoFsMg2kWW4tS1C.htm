------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">This tiny serrated dagger looks like a miniature <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=65">sawtooth sabre</a>. Until activated, it is too small and ornamental to function as a weapon, which might allow it to be passed off as a weapon-shaped decoration.<br /><br /><strong>Activate</strong> <img class="actiondark" style="height: 15px; padding: 0px 2px 0px 2px;" src="https://2e.aonprd.com/Images/Actions/OneAction.png" alt="Single Action" /> Interact; <strong>Effect</strong> You transform the <em>dagger of eternal sleep</em> into a <em>+1 <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=298">grievous</a> striking dagger</em> and Strike an unconscious target with the dagger. If you are not in an encounter or otherwise threatened and you roll a hit with your Strike, you get a critical hit instead. The damage from the Strike and the bleed from the critical specialization effect do not awaken the target, though the target becomes temporarily immune to this effect until the next time it wakes up, meaning further <em>daggers of eternal sleep</em> awaken it as normal. The dagger disintegrates immediately after use.</span></p>
