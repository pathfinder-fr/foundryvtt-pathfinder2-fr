<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> You touch an adjacent creature and attempt a counteract check against one poison or disease afflicting the creature. On a success, you halt the effects of the poison or disease for 1 day, rather than removing it. This temporarily relieves any penalties imposed by the affliction but doesn't cure the effect or count against its duration; the poison or disease is merely halted for a time, and it resumes where it left off once this effect ends.</p>
