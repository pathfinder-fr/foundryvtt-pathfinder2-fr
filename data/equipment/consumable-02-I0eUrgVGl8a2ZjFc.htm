<p>No one is sure if Gorm brews this malty ale himself, but it seems to be an off-duty favorite of the Grand Archive faction leader. The brew packs a heavy punch, and while Gorm officially discourages drinking on the job, boulderhead bock does makes the drinker more self-assured and protects them from conditions that would addle their mental faculties.</p>
<p>For 1 hour, you gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws against effects that would make you stunned or stupefied. However, you also become less aware of your surroundings, taking a –2 item penalty to Perception for 1 hour.</p>
