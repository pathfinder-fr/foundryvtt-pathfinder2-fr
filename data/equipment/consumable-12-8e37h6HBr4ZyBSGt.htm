<p>This gummy liquid disproportionately lengthens your legs, causing you to grow but making your movement awkward. The effect is very noticeable unless your clothes can adequately conceal it.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong> You gain a +3 item bonus to Athletics checks and you gain a +15 foot status bonus to your Speed. In addition, you grow one size larger, but your larger size does not have any additional effects beyond the potential change in space.</p>
<p><strong>Drawback</strong> You take a -1 penalty to AC and a -2 penalty to Reflex saves.</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes.</p>
