------ Description (en) ------
<p>By twisting and twirling this ordinary-looking leather ribbon, you can temporarily bend a rift in space.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong> 1 minute (command, envision, Interact)</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The ribbon spins and swirls, creating a circular loop in the air through which you can spy on a creature on another plane.</p>
<p>This has the effects of a @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.r784cIz17eWujtQj]{Scrying} spell (DC 40) against the creature but functions more as a mundane -albeit interplanar-window; a similar loop appears before the target, and for the duration, both sides can clearly see and hear each other through the created portal, but nothing can pass through.</p>
<p>You can Sustain the Activation to gain the effects of Sustaining the Spell. This activation has the scrying trait.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Pathfinder2eActions'; font-size: 1.8em; display: inline;">1</span>&nbsp;Interact</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> You extend the ribbon to brush against a foe up to 60 feet away. If that creature fails a DC 42 Reflex save, you exchange positions with the target and all of that creature's allies are flat-footed to you until the end of your turn. This activation has the teleportation trait.</p>
