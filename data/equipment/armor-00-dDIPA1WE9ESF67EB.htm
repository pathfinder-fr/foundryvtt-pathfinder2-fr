<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">Explorer’s clothing is sturdy enough that it can be reinforced to protect you, even though it isn’t a suit of armor. It comes in many forms, though the most common sorts look like clerical vestments, monk’s garments, or wizard’s robes, as members of all three classes are likely to avoid wearing armor. For more information on explorer’s clothing, see pages 275–276.&nbsp;</span></p>
