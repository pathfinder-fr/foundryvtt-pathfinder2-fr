------ Description (en) ------
<p>This <em>+2 resilient invisibility chain shirt</em> is itself invisible. Other creatures can't see it at all, allowing you to wear it surreptitiously. Additionally, the armor's invisible composition is quieter and more comfortable than a normal chain shirt. It loses the noisy trait and gains the comfort trait.</p>
