------ Description (en) ------
<p>This 12-foot sword was made by a cyclops in the ancient past. It might be the greatest dragon-killing weapon ever made, and Fafnheir justly fears it, which is why he keeps it hidden in his hoard. Runes of dragon slaying are written down its blade. <em>Ridill</em> is a <em>+3 major striking dragon bane speed adamantine greatsword</em>. While wielding <em>Ridill</em>, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against fear. This increases to +4 if the effect is from a dragon. If you have an ability that depends on Large weapons (such as barbarian giant instinct), it works with <em>Ridill</em>.</p>
<p><em>Ridill</em> is always considered to have the appropriate material or damage type necessary to deactivate a dragon's regeneration or cause the dragon's weakness to apply. For example, <em>Ridill</em> is considered to be cold iron when attacking a linnorm, while it would be treated as having dealt cold damage when attacking a red dragon. If the dragon has more than one weakness, only the highest value applies.</p>
<p><strong>Destruction</strong> If you boil <em>Ridill</em> in the blood of 10 different types of dragon (blue dragon, red dragon, etc.) and drop the eye of a cyclops seer into the brew, <em>Ridill</em> melts away into nothingness.</p>
