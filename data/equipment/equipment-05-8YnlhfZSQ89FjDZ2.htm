<p>This small pendant is usually shaped like a humanoid skull or small animal skull.</p>

<p><strong>Frequency</strong> three times per day;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> You become undetectable to undead creatures for 10 minutes. Undead can't see, hear, or smell you, nor detect you with sensory capabilities such as scent or tremorsense. A creature can attempt a single DC 18 Will saving throw to ignore this effect. If an undead has reason to believe that undetected opponents are present, it can still attempt to Seek or Strike you. If you attempt to use a positive spell to damage undead, use <em>Command Undead</em>, touch or damage an undead creature, or attack any creature while warded in this manner, the pendant's effects immediately end. An undead creature who observes you in this manner or one who succeeds at the Will save is immune to the corpseward pendant for 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
