------ Description (en) ------
<p>This rune prevents enemies from escaping your grasp by @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} to other planes.</p>
<p>When you critically hit a target with a weapon with the anchoring rune, the weapon casts 8th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.ksLCg62cLOojw3gN]{Dimensional Anchor}</em> on the target (<span data-pf2-check="will" data-pf2-traits="abjuration,magical" data-pf2-label="Dimensional Anchor DC" data-pf2-dc="38">DC 38 Will</span>, counteract modifier [[/r 1d20+28 #counteract]]{+28}), except that if the target critically succeeds at its Will save, instead of having no effect, the <em>dimensional anchor</em> lasts for 1 round. When you hit a target with the weapon but don't critically hit, the target is affected by 4th-level <em>dimensional anchor</em> for 1 round without a save (this still uses a counteract modifier of +28).</p>
