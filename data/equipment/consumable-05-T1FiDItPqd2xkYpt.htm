<p>Threads of iridescent golden silk wrap around the core of this magical sling stone. When you activate and shoot a <em>golden chrysalis</em>, rather than making an attack roll for your Strike, you cause the chrysalis to unwind in midair to reveal a magical butterfly that flies in a 30-foot line, scattering golden scale dust that hangs in the air for 1 minute.</p>
<p>A creature that enters or begins its turn in the dust must attempt a <span data-pf2-check="reflex" data-pf2-traits="ammunition,consumable,evocation,magical" data-pf2-label="Avoid Golden Chrysalis DC" data-pf2-dc="19" data-pf2-show-dc="all">Reflex</span> or have its @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisiblity} negated, becoming @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} instead of invisible. This effect applies both if the creature was already invisible and if it benefits from any new invisibility effects before the end of the invisibility negation effect from the golden chrysalis.</p>
<hr />

<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} for 1 minute and its invisibility is negated for 1 minute.</p>
