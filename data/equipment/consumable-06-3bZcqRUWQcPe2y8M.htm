<p>Black powder is a volatile and explosive alchemical substance commonly used in the production of firearm munitions. Black powder becomes inert and useless when wet and must be kept in a sealed, water-tight container.</p>
<p>A keg contains 5,000 doses of black powder and can be detonated in the same way as a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.sHBk2pY0I6dCW2Mw]{Black Powder (Horn)}. As long as the keg is mostly full (at least 4,000 doses remaining) this deals [[/r {3d6}[fire]]]{3d6 fire damage} in a @Template[type:burst|distance:20] (<span data-pf2-check="reflex" data-pf2-traits="damaging-effect, alchemical, consumable" data-pf2-label="Gunpowder Detonation DC" data-pf2-dc="20" data-pf2-show-dc="gm">basic Reflex</span> save). Detonating multiple kegs can increase the area, but not the damage, of this effect; detonating a keg and any horns at the same time in an overlapping area also doesn't increase the damage.</p>
