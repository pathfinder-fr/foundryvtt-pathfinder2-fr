------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">A patchwork of humanoid flesh makes up this grotesque mask stitched together with black silk or wire. It is distinctive for its bulbous orange eye— crafted from a magical glass bauble—and wide row of teeth. When worn, the mask amplifies your ability to sense fear in other creatures. You automatically know the value of the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened} condition of any @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.1wQY3JYyhMYeeV2G]{Observed} creature, and you gain a +1 item bonus to Perception checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} frightened creatures. Whenever you deal precision damage to a frightened creature, you deal 1 additional precision damage. If you are not evil, you are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained} 2 while wearing the <em>Skinsaw mask</em>.</span></p>
