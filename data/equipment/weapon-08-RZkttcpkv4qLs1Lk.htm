------ Description (en) ------
<p>The handles of this <em>+1 striking scythe</em> are made from a dull, gray wood of bone-like consistency, and when you slice with it, a fluttering gust of hundreds of moths' wingbeats fills the air. If you're a devotee of Urgathoa, you can use this scythe as a divine focus, and with every Strike, it exudes a pallid cloud of powdery dust.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class="pf2-icon">f</span> command (divine, necromancy, negative);</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round;</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> You deal [[/r 1d10 #negative]]{1d10 negative damage} to yourself. If your next action is to Strike with the scythe or to Cast a Spell with the disease or negative trait, that Strike or spell deals additional negative damage equal to the damage you took (after any reductions or increases from immunity, resistances, weaknesses).</p>
