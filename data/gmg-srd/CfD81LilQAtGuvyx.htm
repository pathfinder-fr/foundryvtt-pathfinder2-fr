------ Description (en) ------
<p>Your mind becomes trapped forever. This card is fickle, but it often throws the psyche into a prison in an object on a distant plane or planet. Wish or similarly powerful magic can reveal your psyche&rsquo;s location, but it doesn&rsquo;t bring you back. Your comatose body continues to function. Cease drawing cards.</p>
