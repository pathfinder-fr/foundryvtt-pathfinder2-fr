<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The duende is holding brown or yellow earthen objects, such as ginger or animal dung</p>

<p><strong>Effect</strong> The duende makes the objects look, feel, and smell like gold trinkets of a similar size. A creature that touches or Interacts with an affected object can attempt a @Check[type:perception|dc:18] check to disbelieve the illusion, and a successful DC 20 check with Crafting or an appropriate Lore skill (such as Mining Lore) reveals their true nature. The effect ends if the objects are exposed to sunlight.</p>
