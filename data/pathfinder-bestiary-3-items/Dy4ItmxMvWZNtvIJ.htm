------ Description (en) ------
<p>A divine living rune can move only along flat surfaces. If the surface it's on is destroyed (such as a portrait hit by a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.sxQZ6yqTn0czJxVd]{Fireball}</em> spell or a wall being smashed), the living rune takes [[/r 7d6]] damage and is shunted to the nearest flat surface. If there is no flat surface within 5 feet, the living rune is destroyed.</p>
