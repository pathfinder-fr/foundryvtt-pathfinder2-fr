------ Description (en) ------
<p>A wyrmwraith can push through the ectoplasmic veil to temporarily assume a physical form made of ectoplasm. The wyrmwraith loses the incorporeal trait for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}, though they can return to their incorporeal form as a free action before then. Once this ability ends, the wyrmwraith can't use this ability again for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}. While in their ectoplasmic form, the wyrmwraith's AC increases to 43 and they gain 100 temporary Hit Points. They lose their immunity to precision damage and all of their resistances. Their melee Strikes deal slashing and piercing damage, respectively, instead of negative damage.</p>
