------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per 10 minutes</p>
<p>The sphinx recites a riddle and compels up to 10 creatures within 30 feet to answer (@Check[type:will|dc:37] save). The GM either runs the riddle out of character by timing the players' attempts, or picks an appropriate associated skill for the riddle, such as Religion for a riddle involving divine mysteries.</p>
<p>The sphinx gains a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls against any creature that answers incorrectly even once. This bonus lasts for 1 day.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected, but it can choose to try to help solve the riddle.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature attempts to answer the riddle, each round spending at least one action attempting a Recall Knowledge check with the chosen skill (or working on the answer, if using an out of game riddle). This lasts for 1 minute, until the creature successfully answers the riddle, or until an enemy takes a hostile action against the creature, whichever comes first.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> As success but the creature must spend at least two actions each round attempting to answer.</p>
<p><strong>Critical</strong><strong>Failure</strong> As failure, but up to 1 hour.</p>
