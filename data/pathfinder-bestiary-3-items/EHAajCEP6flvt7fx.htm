------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a creature made of flesh is reduced to 0 Hit Points by the dragon's jaws Strike, that creature must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:41] save. If it fails, it dies, and its flesh, made of earth in a metaphysical sense, turns to wood.</p>
<p>The wood is living and might grow into a tree over time, but it can't be used as a body or piece of a body for <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.IkGYwHRLhkuoGReG]{Raise Dead}</em> or other magic that would return the creature to life.</p>
