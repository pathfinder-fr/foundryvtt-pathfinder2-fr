<hr />
<p>Living creatures in the area other than plants slowly transform into non-creature plants. The green man can exclude creatures from this effect, but they must be aware of a creature's presence and location to do so. A non-plant creature in the area must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:45] save immediately before the start of its turn.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected, or if it is slowed by green caress, it reduces its slowed value by 2.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected, or if it is slowed by green caress, it reduces its slowed value by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}, or if it was already slowed by green caress, increases the slowed value by 1, as their body transforms more and more into a non-creature plant. If the creature ever becomes slowed to the point they have no actions left for their turn, they become an inanimate plant, a condition that can only be reversed by <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.MLNeD5sAunV0E23j]{Primal Phenomenon}</em> or similarly powerful magic.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except the creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 2} (or increases the condition value by 2).</p>
