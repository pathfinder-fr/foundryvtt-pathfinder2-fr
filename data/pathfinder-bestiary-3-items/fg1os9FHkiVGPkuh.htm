------ Description (en) ------
<p>Though Krampus still needs to eat, drink, and sleep, he doesn't age and can't die of old age. If Krampus is killed, a new Krampus forms elsewhere in the world after a year's time.</p>
<p>The new Krampus retains the memories of the previous iteration and likely holds a grudge against whoever killed him the year before. If a method to disrupt this cycle exists, it has yet to be discovered by mortals.</p>
