Parent Name: Rhu-chalik
Name: Void Transmission
Nom: 
État: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The rhu-chalik is adjacent to an unconscious creature</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The rhu-chalik spends 10 minutes copying the creature's entire consciousness and mentally sends this copied consciousness through the void of space to their waiting masters.</p>
<p>The target creature is deeply disoriented by this procedure, becoming @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 2} for 1 day afterward. If the creature is revived or moved away from the rhu-chalik during the process, Void Transmission fails and the target is unaffected.</p>
