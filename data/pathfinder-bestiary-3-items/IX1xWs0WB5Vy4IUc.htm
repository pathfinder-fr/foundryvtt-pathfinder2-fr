------ Description (en) ------
<p>The maharaja takes on the appearance of any Medium humanoid. This doesn't change their Speed or their attack and damage modifiers with their Strikes but might change the damage type their Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning). They lose their fangs Strike unless the humanoid form has fangs or a similar unarmed attack, and they lose Four-Fanged Assault unless the new form has four or more heads and fangs.</p>
