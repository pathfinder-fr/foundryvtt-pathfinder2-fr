------ Description (en) ------
<p>The guecubu stomps, and the ground breaks and ripples in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30], erupting in razor-sharp, crisscrossing spikes of rock that deal [[/r {3d8}[piercing]]]{3d8 piercing damage} to creatures in the area (@Check[type:reflex|dc:26|basic:true] save).</p>
<p>The area becomes difficult terrain and hazardous terrain, with each square dealing 3 piercing damage to a creature that moves through it. A guecubu is immune to these effects.</p>
<p>Ground under the effects of a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Dbd5W6G8U2vzWolN]{Consecrate}</em> ritual or a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.mpGCMTldMVa0pWYs]{Circle of Protection}</em> spell tuned against evil or chaos can't be affected by this ability.</p>
