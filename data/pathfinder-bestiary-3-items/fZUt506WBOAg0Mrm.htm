------ Description (en) ------
<p>The clockwork dragon attacks with the sharp point of its tail.</p>
<p>It makes a tail Strike against each creature in a @Template[type:line|distance:20], rolling the attack roll once and applying the result to each target. Any creature hit takes @Localize[PF2E.PersistentDamage.Bleed4d6.success] (doubled on a critical hit). This counts as two attacks for the dragon's multiple attack penalty.</p>
