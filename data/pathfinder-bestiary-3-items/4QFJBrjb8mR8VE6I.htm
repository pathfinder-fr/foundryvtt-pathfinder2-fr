------ Description (en) ------
<p>A storm hag can perform a special <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.XkDCzMIyc0YOjw05]{Control Weather}</em> ritual, which requires no secondary casters, to change the weather within 5 miles of her location for [[/r 4d12 #hours]]{4d12 hours}. The primary check is a @Check[type:occultism|dc:23] check, and she can't get an outcome worse than a failure.</p>
<p>The storm hag can create only hurricanes, thunderstorms, and tornadoes, but she can do so regardless of the current season. She can also quell natural weather events but never willingly does so.</p>
