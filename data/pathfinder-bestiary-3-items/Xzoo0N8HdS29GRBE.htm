------ Description (en) ------
<p>A divine warden always wields its patron deity's favored weapon. If the weapon is a ranged weapon, the divine warden automatically generates new ammunition with each attack. For a divine warden of 4th level or higher, the deity's favored weapon gains the effects of a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.DxCuJKynlnMQZHgp]{Striking} rune while the divine warden wields it; at 12th level, these effects are of a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.KCQRFvUgbyclvOGi]{Greater Striking} rune, and at 19th level, they're instead of a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.woxl2FrrgAcJDu0t]{Major Striking} rune.</p>
