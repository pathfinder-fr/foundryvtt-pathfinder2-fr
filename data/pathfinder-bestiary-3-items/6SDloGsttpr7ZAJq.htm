------ Description (en) ------
<p>While aghashes hate all mortals, they particularly despise beautiful objects and beautiful or charismatic mortals. When not in physical peril, an aghash is compelled to destroy art and other works of beauty. An aghash can't enter an area of pristine beauty without first marring it in some way.</p>
<p>Given a choice, an aghash attacks a foe with the highest Charisma score first. If barred from doing so by force or some magical effect, they take [[/r {1d6}[mental]]]{1d6 mental damage} at the end of their turn.</p>
