------ Description (en) ------
<p>The jeweler beast creates imitation jewelry within its own digestive system. This takes about 4 hours.</p>
<p>Determining the jewelry is fake works like detecting a forgery, using either Perception or Crafting instead of Perception or Society, with a DC of 25.</p>
<p>The process of creating fake jewelry also places an enchantment inside the item. Anyone who dons the imitation jewelry is targeted with a DC 24 <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.qwlh6aDgi86U3Q7H]{Suggestion}</em> spell with a duration of 1 hour on a failure or 24 hours on a critical failure. A creature that fails learns the location where the fake jewelry was created and is compelled to collect their valuable belongings and bring them to that location. Removing the imitation jewelry ends the spell immediately, but the wearer can't take it off voluntarily.</p>
