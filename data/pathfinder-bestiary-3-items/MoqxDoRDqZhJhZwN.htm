------ Description (en) ------
<p>Whenever the skeleton infantry Stride, they first Form Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then move up to their Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the infantry enter difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to all the guards.</p>
