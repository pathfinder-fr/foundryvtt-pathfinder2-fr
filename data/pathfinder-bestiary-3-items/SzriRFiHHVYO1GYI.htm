------ Description (en) ------
<p>Whenever a living creature touches or is touched by a grimple (including via a successful unarmed melee Strike), it must succeed at a @Check[type:reflex|dc:13] save or become infested by gremlin lice.</p>
<p>While infested, the targeted creature is distracted by the itching sensation and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 1}, though it can use an @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F]{Interact} action to scratch at the itching lice to suppress the stupefied condition from the lice for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>
<p>The infestation ends after 24 hours or until the creature is submerged in water or exposed to a severe cold environment, whichever comes first.</p>
