------ Description (en) ------
<p>The condition of a stone lion's vessel dictates the lion's maximum Hit Point value. Undamaged, the vessel is an object with 50 Hit Points (BT 25). When the lion is in spirit form, damaging it doesn't hurt the vessel, but damaging the vessel deals an equal amount of damage to the lion. When the lion Inhabits its Vessel, they're a single target, and damage reduces the Hit Points of both the lion and the vessel. If the vessel is broken, the lion can still fight normally while inhabiting it and suffers no ill effect, but if the vessel is ever destroyed, the lion is instantly slain and can't reconstitute.</p>
