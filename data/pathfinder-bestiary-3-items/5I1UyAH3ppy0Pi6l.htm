------ Description (en) ------
<p>The tyrannosaurus skeleton bends down, attempting to skewer one adjacent creature on one of its massive ribs. The creature takes [[/r {2d10+9}[piercing]]]{2d10+9 piercing damage} (@Check[type:reflex|dc:28|basic:true] save). If the creature fails its save and is Medium or smaller, it's also impaled and stuck to the rib. It moves with the skeleton and takes [[/r {2d6}[persistent,bleed]]] @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Bleed Damage} until it either Escapes or someone uses Force Open to break the rib (either is DC 28).</p>
