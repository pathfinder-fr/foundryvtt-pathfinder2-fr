------ Description (en) ------
<p>When the rancorous priesthood Casts a Spell, their constituent members combine their efforts into casting a more powerful version of the spell than any one member could achieve alone.</p>
<p>When Casting a Spell that has an area of a burst, cone, or line and doesn't have a duration, increase the area of that spell. Add 5 feet to the radius of a burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst with a smaller radius is not affected). Add 5 feet to the length of a cone or line that is normally 15 feet long or smaller, and add 10 feet to the length of a larger cone or line.</p>
