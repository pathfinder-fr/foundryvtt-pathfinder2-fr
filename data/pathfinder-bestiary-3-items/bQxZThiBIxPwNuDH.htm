<p>On a hit, the target must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:20] save or be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} for 1 minute or until it spends 3 @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F]{Interact} actions wiping the salt out of its eyes. On a critical hit, a target that fails its Fortitude save is also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} for 1 round.</p>
