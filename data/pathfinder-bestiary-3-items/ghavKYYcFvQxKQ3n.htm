------ Description (en) ------
<p>The tomb giant turns the spiritual tide on a creature that has just died, temporarily transforming it into a volatile vessel of negative energy. The tomb giant touches a creature that died in the past 24 hours, infusing its flesh and bone with negative energy. Once during the next hour, the tomb giant can spend a single action (from any distance) to release this negative energy from the corpse in an explosion that deals [[/r {10d8}[negative]]]{10d8 negative damage} energy in a @Template[type:burst|distance:15] (@Check[type:fortitude|dc:32|basic:true] save); if not released before the end of the hour, the energy dissipates harmlessly. The tomb giant can't use Font of Death while a previous corpse remains infused.</p>
