------ Description (en) ------
<p>When slain, a kovintus immediately and permanently transforms into a part of the natural environment: a stone outcropping in a rocky area, a rivulet near a body of water, a young tree in a forest, or a low-lying cloud atop a high mountain. This ability has the trait appropriate to the environment (such as air, earth, plant, or water). This piece of the environment looks ordinary to most, but other kovintus can easily identify this as their kin. A kovintus slain far from any appropriate terrain transforms into a feature matching the terrain where they were born.</p>
