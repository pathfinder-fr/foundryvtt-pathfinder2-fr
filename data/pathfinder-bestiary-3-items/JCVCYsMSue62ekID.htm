<p><strong>Effect</strong> The rhu-chalik creates nightmarish visions in the target's mind. The target must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:24] save.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target creature is unaffected and temporarily immune to Project Terror for 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>

Failing additional saves against this effect increases the frightened condition value by 2; if this would increase the target's frightened value beyond frightened 4, the target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} for 1 round and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 4}.</p>
