------ Description (en) ------
<p>The flumph sprays a @Template[type:line|distance:20] of foul-smelling liquid. Each creature caught in the spray must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:16] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} (@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 2} on a critical failure).</p>
<p>The odor from the spray lingers for [[/r 1d4 #hours]]{1d4 hours} on all creatures that failed their saves. The sprayed creatures can be detected by smell at a range of 100 feet, and any creatures adjacent to them take a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against Spray Perfume or to recover from the sickened condition.</p>
