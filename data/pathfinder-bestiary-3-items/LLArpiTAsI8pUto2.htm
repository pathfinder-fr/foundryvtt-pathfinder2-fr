------ Description (en) ------
<p>A home with a friendly domovoi is blessed, as the domovoi cooks, cleans, fetches water, and does a hundred other small tasks.</p>
<p>A home so blessed never suffers from random accidents such as fires, and any checks to Craft, Earn Income, Repair, or Subsist in the home receive a +2 circumstance bonus. If the domovoi is unfriendly, such checks take a -2 circumstance penalty instead, as the domovoi hides things, makes noise when people try to sleep, tangles weaving, and otherwise makes life a misery.</p>
<p>A domovoi must spend a week in a place before these benefits occur.</p>
