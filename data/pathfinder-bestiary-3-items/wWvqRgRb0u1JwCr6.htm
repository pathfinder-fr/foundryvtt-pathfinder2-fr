------ Description (en) ------
<p>Whenever the troop Strides, they first Form Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then moves up to their Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the troop enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the whole troop.</p>
