------ Description (en) ------
<p>A creature hit by a vilderavn's melee attack becomes cursed. It takes @Localize[PF2E.PersistentDamage.Bleed2d6.success] that's difficult to stanch. The DC to stop the bleeding using @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.MHLuKy4nQO2Z4Am1]{Administer First Aid} is 35, and healing the creature to full HP doesn't automatically end the bleeding. Removing the curse ends the bleeding.</p>
