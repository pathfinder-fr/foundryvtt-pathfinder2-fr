<p>The tooth fairies try to pry out one of their target's teeth. One enemy in the swarm's space takes [[/r {4d6}[bludgeoning]]]{4d6 bludgeoning damage} (@Check[type:reflex|dc:20|basic:true] save). On a failed save, the target takes [[/r {2}[persistent,bleed]]] @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.lDVqvLKA6eF3Df60]{Persistent Bleed Damage} and a -1 status penalty to Charisma-based skill checks, and they must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] check to Cast a Spell with a verbal component or the spell is disrupted. The penalty and spellcasting condition last for 1 day, or until the stolen tooth is returned and the target regains at least 1 Hit Point.</p>
