------ Description (en) ------
<p>The etioling draws in a deep breath and holds it, temporarily suspending their biological processes and becoming undead.</p>
<p>The etioling gains the undead and incorporeal traits and becomes immune to bleed, death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, and sleep. Any such effects the etioling is currently suffering from are suspended, but take effect again once they take a breath. They gain a fly Speed of 25 feet, resistance 10 to all damage (except force, @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.JQdwHECogcTzdd8R]{Ghost Touch}, or positive; double this resistance vs. non-magical) while they hold their breath.They can't cast spells during this time.</p>
<p>Death Gasp lasts as long as the etioling blightmage holds their breath (up to 8 rounds).</p>
