<p><strong>Effect</strong> The betobeto-san Steps. They then create two illusory decoys of sound within 15 feet of them that mimic the sounds of their ominous footsteps.</p>
<p>These decoys act independently on the betobeto-san's initiative with 2 actions apiece. They can only Sneak or Stride, and they have a Speed of 35 feet. Use the betobeto-san's Stealth DC (typically 37) against attempts to Seek or disbelieve a decoy.</p>
<p>Each decoy lasts for 1 minute. Any existing decoys vanish if the betobeto-san uses this ability again.</p>
