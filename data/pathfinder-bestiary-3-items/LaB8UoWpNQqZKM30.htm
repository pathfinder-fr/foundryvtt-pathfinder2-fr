------ Description (en) ------
<p>The bison kicks up dust and shakes the ground as it charges.</p>
<p>The stampeding bison Strides up to twice its Speed in a straight line, dealing [[/r {4d6+6}[bludgeoning]]]{4d6+6 bludgeoning damage} (@Check[type:reflex|dc:21|basic:true] save) to any Medium or smaller creature in its path.</p>
<p>Multiple bison can participate in Rolling Thunder by spending this ability's actions and waiting to charge until the herd is ready. Before the beginning of their next turn, they can then charge as a reaction triggered by an adjacent bison beginning its Rolling Thunder charge. All bison in the combined charge must charge in parallel lines, so the areas can't overlap. The combined charge deals an additional [[/r {3d6}[bludgeoning]]]{3d6 bludgeoning damage} to creatures in the area, and a creature that fails the Reflex saving throw is also knocked @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone}.</p>
