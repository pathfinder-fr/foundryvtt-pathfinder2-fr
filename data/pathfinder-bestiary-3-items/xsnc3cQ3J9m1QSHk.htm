------ Description (en) ------
<p>The triumph siktempora pushes themself beyond their limits to secure victory over a chosen foe. They choose one target they can see and reach with a single Stride action. They attempt to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.2u915NdUyQan6uKF]{Demoralize} that target, ignoring the typical limitations on distance and with no penalty for not sharing a language with the target. They then Stride and attempt one Athletics attack action (such as @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.PMbdMWc2QroouFGD]{Grapple} or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Dt6B1slsBy8ipJu9]{Disarm}) against the target.</p>
