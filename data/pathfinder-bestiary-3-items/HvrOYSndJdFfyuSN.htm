------ Description (en) ------
<p>A nikaramsa is in fact a Medium creature, but appears as a Large creature due to the force of their personality. A creature interacting with the nikaramsa can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:36] save to see the nikaramsa as they truly are. If the creature succeeds, the reach of nikaramsa's attacks against that foe decrease to 5 feet (10 feet for their tongue).</p>
<p>If all creatures in the nikaramsa's vicinity successfully disbelieve this illusion, the nikaramsa becomes Medium and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled 2} for as long as everyone sees their true form.</p>
