Parent Name: Dybbuk
Name: Malevolent Possession
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>The dybbuk attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature.</p>
<p>This has the same effect as the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.wU6hNzK8Yfqdmc8m]{Possession}</em> spell (DC 34) with an unlimited duration, except since the dybbuk doesn't have a physical body, they aren't unconscious, and aren't paralyzed when the effect ends, though they take [[/r {5d6}[force]]]{5d6 force damage} if the body is knocked unconscious or killed.</p>
<p>If the dybbuk took control of the target with Malevolent Possession, when the dybbuk departs, the target has only incoherent memories of the interval it was possessed. If a creature dies while possessed by the dybbuk and its corpse remains intact, the dybbuk can immediately inhabit the corpse (see Inhabit Object) as a reaction, in which case the corpse becomes an animated object.</p>
