<hr />
<p>A clacking skull swarm emits a cacophony of chattering. A creature entering or beginning its turn within the area must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:29] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.yblD8fOR1J8rDwEQ]{Confused} for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that swarm's chattering teeth for 24 hours. The swarm can stop or resume this ability as a free action.</p>
