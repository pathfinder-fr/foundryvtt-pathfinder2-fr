------ Description (en) ------
<p>The bone ship is compelled not by a single mind, but by the collective consciousness of dead sailors' souls.</p>
<p>The ship is immune to mental effects that target only a specific number of creatures. It's still subject to mental effects that affect all creatures in an area.</p>
<p>Any creature that tries to communicate with the ship via telepathy or read its thoughts hears the dying screams and gasps of the crew, and is targeted with a 9th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.8kJbiBEjMWG4VUjs]{Warp Mind}</em> spell (DC 41).</p>
<p>The ship animates skeletal crew members out of its own bones, arming them with rusty old cutlasses or other armaments so they can attack anyone who comes next to the ship. These entities have appearances matching those the bound souls had in life but aren't truly individuals; anything that targets them in fact targets the bone ship they're a part of.</p>
<p>Hundreds of black soul gems decorate the ship's exterior, each holding one soul. These gems can hold souls of creatures whose level was 16th or lower, and they have no value. If the ship is destroyed, all these gems shatter, freeing the souls within.</p>
