------ Description (en) ------
<p>Procyals' core value is whimsy, though unlike for chaotic tricksters, procyals' playful actions have a pattern and their pranks always come with a valuable lesson, even if it takes a long time to decipher the meaning.</p>
<p>Receiving and growing from such a lesson requires at least 10 minutes of interaction with the Procyal but can take much longer.</p>
<p>A character who learns from the procyal's lesson gains the benefits of the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW]{Aid} reaction from the procyal once during the next month. Afterwards, they become immune to this effect from all procyals.</p>
