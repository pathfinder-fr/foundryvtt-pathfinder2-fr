------ Description (en) ------
<p>The clockwork spy records all sounds within 25 feet onto a small gemstone worth 1 gp embedded in its body. The clockwork spy can record up to 1 hour of sound on a single gemstone. Once it begins recording, it can't cease recording early, nor can it record onto a gemstone that already contains a recording.</p>
<p>Some clockwork spies contain multiple gemstones to allow for a series of recordings. Since clockwork spies are not intelligent, they must be given simple commands regarding when to start recording sounds. A clockwork spy can differentiate between different kinds of creatures but not between specific individuals.</p>
<p>The spy can start or stop playback of recorded sound by spending a single action. Removing a gemstone from or installing a gemstone into a clockwork spy requires a successful @Check[type:thievery|dc:14|name:Remove/Install Gemstone|traits:action:disable-device] check to Disable a Device; on a failure, the gemstone is undamaged, but any recorded sounds are erased and the gemstone still can't be used to make another recording.</p>
