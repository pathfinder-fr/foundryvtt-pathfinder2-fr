------ Description (en) ------
<p>A hesperid queen is tied to an isolated region such as an island or island chain, a remote coast, or a secluded valley. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the hesperid queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals that would harm the environment, such as <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.7yWXx3qC4eFNHhxD]{Blight}</em>, with a [[/r 1d20+37]] counteract modifier and a counteract level of 10.</p>
<p>When the hesperid queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, their warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the hesperid queen swiftly heals the entire region.</p>
