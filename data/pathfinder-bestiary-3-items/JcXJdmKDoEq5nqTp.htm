------ Description (en) ------
<p>Dorus have a weakness for secrets, hoarding them like a miser hoards gold. A creature can tempt a doru with some bit of obscure knowledge the doru doesn't know or thinks they don't know.</p>
<p>Presenting the hint of the secret is a single action, which has the concentrate and linguistic traits, and requires a skill check using Deception, Lore, or Performance (or some other appropriate skill determined by the GM) against the doru's Will DC.</p>
<p>On a success, the doru is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AdPVz7rbaVSRxHFg]{Fascinated} for as long as the presenter draws out the explanation of the secret (spending 1 action each round doing so, to a maximum of 1 minute). On a critical success, the doru is fascinated for that duration plus 1 minute more as it ponders the implications of the secret. Regardless of the outcome, the doru is temporarily immune to that creature's attempts to present it with secrets for 1 day.</p>
