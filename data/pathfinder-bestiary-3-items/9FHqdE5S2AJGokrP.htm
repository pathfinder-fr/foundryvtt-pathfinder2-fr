------ Description (en) ------
<p>The kuchisake-onna asks a single adjacent target, “Am I pretty?” The target must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:35|traits:mental] save. If it fails, it is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} for 1 round, and if it critically fails, it is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed} for 1 round, though still able to respond to the question; this is a mental effect.</p>
<p>If the target responds “No,” the kuchisake-onna makes two silver scissors Strikes against the target. If the target responds “Yes,” the kuchisake-onna makes no Strikes this turn and must use Even Now? as their next action (waiting until the first action of their next turn, if necessary). If the target otherwise responds in a confusing or noncommittal manner, the kuchisake-onna becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} to all creatures for 1 round but can otherwise act normally.</p>
