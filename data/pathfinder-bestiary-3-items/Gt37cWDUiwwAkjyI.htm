------ Description (en) ------
<p>Whenever the nightmarchers Stride, they first Form Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then move. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any of the nightmarchers' squares enter difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the whole group.</p>
