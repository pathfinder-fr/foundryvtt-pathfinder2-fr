------ Description (en) ------
<p>A blood hag wears a covering of skin stolen from a humanoid creature she has killed, hiding her true form and granting her the effects of a 4th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.c2bTWBNO1BYX4Zfg]{Misdirection}</em>, with herself as the primary target and the creature whose skin she is wearing as the secondary target.</p>
<p>Spreading coarse salt inside the skin prevents the hag from putting it back on, forcing her to keep her fiery form until she kills another humanoid and spends 1 hour turning it into a new disguise.</p>
