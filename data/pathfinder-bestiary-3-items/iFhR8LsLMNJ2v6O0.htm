------ Description (en) ------
<p>The green man's vines leach away magic and transform it into life essence for the green man. On a successful vine Strike, the green man attempts to counteract one spell active on the target (typically one vexing the green man, or determined randomly if they aren't aware of specific effects), with a counteract level of 10 and a modifier of [[/r 1d20+38]].</p>
<p>If the effect is counteracted, the green man gains [[/r 30]] temporary Hit Points that last for 10 minutes.</p>
