------ Description (en) ------
<p>The brimorak spits their boiling blood in a @Template[type:line|distance:20] that deals [[/r {6d6}[fire]]]{6d6 fire damage} (@Check[type:reflex|dc:21|basic:true] save). The brimorak can't use their Breath Weapon again for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>
<p>The ground within this area becomes slippery, with the effects of a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Wu0xFpewMKRK3HG8]{Grease}</em> spell targeting an area until it's cleaned up or the brimorak is able to use their Breath Weapon again, whichever comes first.</p>
