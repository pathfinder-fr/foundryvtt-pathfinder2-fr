<p>When the ouroboros takes slashing or piercing damage, or when Devour Tail ends, blood gushes from the wound in a @Template[type:cone|distance:15]. Each creature in the area takes [[/r {5d6}[acid]]]{5d6 acid damage} (@Check[type:reflex|dc:41|basic:true] save). A creature that takes any damage is exposed to the ouroboros's regenerative blood.</p>
<p>.Where the blood falls upon ground, it coagulates into magical snakes that bite at anyone who passes. This is hazardous terrain deals [[/r {17}[piercing]]]{17 piercing damage} and [[/r 5]] poison damage to any non-ouroboros creature that moves through the square or ends its turn there.
