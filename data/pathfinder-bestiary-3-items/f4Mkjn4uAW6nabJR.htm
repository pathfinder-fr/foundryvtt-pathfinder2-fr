<p><span class="pf2-icon">1</span> or <span class="pf2-icon">2</span></p>
<p>The haniver attempts to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.RDXXE7wMrSPCLv5k]{Steal} a small object off a target's person. If they succeed, they also rifle through and rearrange the contents of the target's pockets, pouches, and other containers.</p>
<p>The next time the target attempts to draw a weapon or retrieve a worn item, doing so requires two @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F]{Interact} actions instead of one.</p>
<p>The haniver can Steal an object that's closely guarded using this action without the -5 penalty, though not objects that would be extremely noticeable or time-consuming to remove.</p>
<p>They can spend 2 actions instead of 1 to use this ability to Steal from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard.</p>
