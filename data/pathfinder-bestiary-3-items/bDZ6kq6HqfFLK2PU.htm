------ Description (en) ------
<p>The green man's thorns embed themselves into any creature they damage, taking root into the ground. A target damaged by a thorn has its Speeds halved, and it can't Step, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.cS9nfDRGD83bNU1p]{Fly}, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.b5sGjGlBf58f8jn0]{Air Walk}</em><em>,</em> or otherwise leave the ground until the thorn is removed.</p>
<p>Removing a thorn requires 3 @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F]{Interact} actions, which don't have to be consecutive. If the creature performing the final action doesn't succeed at a @Check[type:medicine|dc:45] check as part of that action, the target takes [[/r 10d6]] damage upon the thorn's removal.</p>
