------ Description (en) ------
<p>Though phantoms aren't alive, neither are they undead, and they are uniquely vulnerable to the effects of death.</p>
<p>A phantom whose Hit Points are reduced to 0 as a result of a death effect (such as from a spell like <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Z9OrRXKgAPv6Hn5l]{Finger of Death}</em>) is immediately whisked away to the River of Souls, where their soul resumes the usual path to the afterlife.</p>
