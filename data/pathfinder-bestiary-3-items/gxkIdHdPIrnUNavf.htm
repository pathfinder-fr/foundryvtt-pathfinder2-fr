------ Description (en) ------
<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Trigger</strong> Another creature targets the scalescribe with a spell requiring verbal components</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The scalescribe attempts to copy the incantation onto a scroll by attempting a counteract check (counteract level 2, counteract modifier [[/r 1d20+10]]) with the following effects instead of the normal effects of counteracting. The spell still affects the scalescribe, regardless of the results of this check.</p>
<p>The scalescribe can Cast a Spell from any scroll they Transcribe as if it were on their spell list. Transcribing a new scroll renders any previously Transcribed scroll inert.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> If the triggering spell's level was no more than 3 higher than the scalescribe's counteract level, the scalescribe captures a copy of the spell in a scroll that appears in their hand. This scroll can be used normally but fades after 24 hours if not used before then.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but only if the spell's level is no more than 1 higher than the scalescribe's counteract level.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> As critical success, but only if the spell's level is lower than the scalescribe's counteract level.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The scalescribe fails to copy the spell.</p>
