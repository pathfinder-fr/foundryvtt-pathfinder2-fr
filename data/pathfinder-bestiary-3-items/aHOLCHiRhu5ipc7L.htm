<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Trigger</strong> The etioling is the target of a physical ranged attack</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The etioling interposes a wave of ectoplasm between themself and the source of the ranged attack, giving them a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the attack misses, the ectoplasm deflected it. The ectoplasm can't deflect unusually large or heavy ranged projectiles (such as boulders or ballista bolts).</p>
