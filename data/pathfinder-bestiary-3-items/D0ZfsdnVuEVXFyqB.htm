------ Description (en) ------
<p>The angazhani beats a single opponent with all four of their brawny arms, leaving their foe nowhere to dodge.</p>
<p>The angazhani makes a fist Strike. On a successful attack, they deal fist damage to the target plus an additional [[/r 3d8]] damage, and they meet the requirements to Rend the target this turn, even if they didn't hit on two consecutive Strikes. Even on a failed attack, the angazhani deals the damage from one fist Strike to the target, though they still miss completely on a critical failure.</p>
<p>This ability counts as four attacks toward an angazhani's multiple attack penalty. After using this ability, the angazhani is flat-footed until the beginning of their next turn.</p>
