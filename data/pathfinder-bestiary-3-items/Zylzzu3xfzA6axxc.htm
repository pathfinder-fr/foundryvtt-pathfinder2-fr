------ Description (en) ------
<p>A winter hag can spend 1 day performing a specific ritual to create a <em>+1 Striking Staff</em> of black ice. Once per day, she can use the staff to cast <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.3puDanGfpEt6jK5k]{Cone of Cold}</em><em>.</em> The staff's magic functions only in the hands of the hag who created it; for anyone else, it is a mundane staff. If the hag dies or if the staff remains in another creature's possession for 24 hours, the staff melts into a puddle of foul-smelling water.</p>
