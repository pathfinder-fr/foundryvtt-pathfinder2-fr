------ Description (en) ------
<p>The condition of a stone cub's vessel dictates the cub's maximum Hit Point value. Undamaged, the vessel is an object with 28 Hit Points (BT 14). When the cub is in spirit form, damaging it doesn't hurt the vessel, but damaging the vessel deals an equal amount of damage to the cub. When the cub Inhabits its Vessel, they're a single target, and damage reduces the Hit Points of both the cub and the vessel. If the vessel is broken, the cub can still fight normally while inhabiting it and suffers no ill effect, but if the vessel is ever destroyed, the cub is instantly slain and can't reconstitute.</p>
