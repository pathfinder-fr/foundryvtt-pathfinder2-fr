------ Description (en) ------
<p>The blood hag removes her borrowed skin and transforms into a brilliant ball of fire.</p>
<p>She becomes amorphous, gains the fire trait and a fly Speed of 60 feet, becomes immune to fire, and emits light as a torch. She loses her melee Strikes and can't Drain Blood, but she deals [[/r {3d10}[fire]]]{3d10 fire damage} (@Check[type:reflex|dc:26|basic:true] save) to each creature that touches her, as well as to each creature that succeeds at a melee Strike against her with an unarmed attack or from an adjacent space.</p>
<p>If her skin is intact, she can return to her normal form by spending a single action that has the manipulate trait while adjacent to the skin.</p>
<p>The hag can instead Assume Fiery Form as a single action, bursting through her skin in a blast of flames. Doing so destroys her borrowed skin and deals [[/r {9d6}[fire]]]{9d6 fire damage} (@Check[type:reflex|dc:26|basic:true] save) in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:20].</p>
