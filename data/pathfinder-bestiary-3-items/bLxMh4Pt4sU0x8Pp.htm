------ Description (en) ------
<p>A love siktempora can provide verbal components and auditory performances for their composition spells even though they can't speak. They do so without needing to make noise, as all creatures within range of their telepathy hear the components in their mind. However, the siktempora can do so only as long as at least one other creature with an Intelligence modifier of +0 or higher is within the range of their telepathy.</p>
