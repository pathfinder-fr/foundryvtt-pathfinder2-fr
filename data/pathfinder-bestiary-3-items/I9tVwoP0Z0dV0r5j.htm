------ Description (en) ------
<p>The corrupted relic is an amulet cursed to contain a malevolent spirit. The statistics in this stat block are for the spirit when it's manifested (see Manifest). The amulet can't take any actions except Sudden Manifestation and Manifest. As long as the spirit is manifested, the amulet is immune to spells and magical abilities and uses the saves listed here.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the spirit is manifested, the amulet can be targeted by Strikes (AC 21, Hardness 5, BT 10). It is not incorporeal. If the amulet becomes broken, the spirit is bound within and can't Manifest, and if the amulet is destroyed, so is the spirit. Destroying the spirit frees the amulet from its curse.</p>
