------ Description (en) ------
<p>Like normal objects, an animated silverware swarm has Hardness. This Hardness reduces any damage the swarm takes by an amount equal to the Hardness. Once an animated silverware swarm is reduced to fewer than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks, removing the Hardness and reducing its Armor Class to 12.</p>
