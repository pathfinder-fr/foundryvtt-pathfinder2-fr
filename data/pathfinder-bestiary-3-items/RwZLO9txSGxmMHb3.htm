------ Description (en) ------
<p>The lampad queen focuses their beauty upon a target within their aura. The creature must attempt a Will save.</p>
<p>On a failure, it is affected as if by the queen's beauty aura; if it was already affected by the aura, the conflicting emotions from the lampad queen's beauty intensify, causing the target to no longer get a flat check to end the confusion when it takes damage.</p>
<p>The lampad queen can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to focus the emotions of a confused creature toward a particular emotion, causing it to spend its next turn sobbing uncontrollably, fawning over the lampad queen, or otherwise performing no actions beyond experiencing its emotions.</p>
<p>Regardless of the save, the target is temporarily immune to Focus Beauty until the start of the lampad queen's next turn.</p>
