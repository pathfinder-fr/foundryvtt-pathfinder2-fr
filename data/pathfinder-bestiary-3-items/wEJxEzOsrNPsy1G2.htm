------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The Leng ghoul is adjacent to the corpse of a creature that retains flesh on its bones</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The Leng ghoul devours a chunk of the corpse and regains [[/r {6d6}[healing]]]{6d6 Hit Points}. At the same time, they also absorb some of the memories stored in the flesh from when the corpse was alive, gaining a +1 status bonus to all skill checks for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>The Leng ghoul can immediately attempt an Occultism check to learn one non-secret memory the corpse had when it was alive (use the standard DC for the creature's level). The exact memory learned is determined by the GM but is typically something of use to the Leng ghoul. The memory can't be one the creature was trying to keep secret unless the check was a critical success.</p>
<p>A Leng ghoul can Absorb Memories from any given corpse only once.</p>
