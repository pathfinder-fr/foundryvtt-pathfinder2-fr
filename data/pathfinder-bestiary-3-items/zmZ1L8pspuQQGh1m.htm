Parent Name: Blood Hag

Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> A @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.VcDeM8A5oI6VqhbM]{Restrained}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}, or willing creature is within the blood hag's reach</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The hag sinks her fangs into the creature to drink its blood. This requires a successful Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions.</p>
<p>The victim becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1}. The hag regains [[/r {15}[healing]]]{15 Hit Points}, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points that last for 1 hour. Drinking blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any Hit Points to the hag but increases the victim's drained value by 1, killing the victim when it reaches drained 5.</p>
<p>A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful @Check[type:medicine|dc:20] check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained condition by 1 after 10 minutes.</p>
