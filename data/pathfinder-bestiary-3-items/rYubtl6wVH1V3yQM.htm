------ Description (en) ------
<p>A living graffiti can move only along flat surfaces. If the surface it's on is destroyed (such as a portrait hit by a <em>fireball </em>spell or a wall being smashed), the graffiti takes [[/r {2d6}]]{2d6 damage} and is shunted to the nearest flat surface. If there is no flat surface within 5 feet, the graffiti is destroyed.</p>
