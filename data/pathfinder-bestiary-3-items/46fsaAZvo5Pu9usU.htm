------ Description (en) ------
<p>Whenever the cavalry brigade Strides, the brigade first Forms Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then moves. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the brigade enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the whole brigade.</p>
