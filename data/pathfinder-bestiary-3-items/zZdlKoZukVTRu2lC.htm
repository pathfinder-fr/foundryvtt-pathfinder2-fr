------ Description (en) ------
<p>A lampad is mystically bonded to a single cavern or other self-contained underground area and must remain within 300 feet of it.</p>
<p>If they move beyond that range, they become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} and are unable to recover. They must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:19] save every hour or increase the sickened value by 1 (to a maximum of sickened 4).</p>
<p>After 24 hours, they become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1}, with this value increasing by 1 every additional 24 hours. A lampad can perform a 24-hour ritual to bond to a new cavern.</p>
