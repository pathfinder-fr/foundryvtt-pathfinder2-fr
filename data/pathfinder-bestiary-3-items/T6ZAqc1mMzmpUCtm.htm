------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a levaloch hits a creature with their barbed net, the net wraps around the target, which becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.i3OJZU2nk64Df3xm]{Clumsy 1} and takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds.</p>
<p>If the Strike was a critical success, the target is also immobilized. When a creature Escapes (DC 22), or if the Strike misses, the net crumbles into rust.</p>
<p>Each time a creature attempts to Escape, it takes [[/r {1d6}[slashing]]]{1d6 slashing damage} from the net's barbs, regardless of whether the attempt succeeds.</p>
