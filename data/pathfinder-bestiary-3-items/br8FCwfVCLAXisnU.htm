------ Description (en) ------
<p>Draconals embody the core value of wisdom, but every path to wisdom and enlightenment differs, so draconals' powers vary by temperament and coloration. A draconal's scale color determines their associated energy damage type.</p>
<p>They gain resistance 15 to that damage type, deal 4d6 extra damage of that type with their Strikes, and deal 21d6 damage of that type with their breath weapon. They gain additional wisdom in the form of the basic and advanced domain spells from one domain, chosen from four domains available to draconals with their scale color. This red draconal has the protection and sun domains.</p>
