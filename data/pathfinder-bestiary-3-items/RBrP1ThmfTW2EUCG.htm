<p>Wind whistles through the namorrodor's jutting bones with an eerie tone. A creature entering or beginning its turn in the area must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:19] save, becoming @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 1} on a failure (@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2}on a critical failure). A creature can't reduce its frightened condition below 1 as long as it's in the aura.</p>
