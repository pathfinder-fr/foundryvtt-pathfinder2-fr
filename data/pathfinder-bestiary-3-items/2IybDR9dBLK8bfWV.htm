<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The mothman casts any spell of 5th level or lower that normally takes 2 or fewer actions to cast, whether they have those spells in their innate spells or not.</p>
<p>They can use this ability only if doing so steers the flow of fate in its proper course toward a disaster or otherwise significantly memorable event.</p>
<p>What the proper flow of fate entails is determined by the GM, but some examples include casting <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Ucf8eynbZMfUucjE]{Illusory Scene}</em> to coax someone to a portentous location, casting <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.R9xqCBblkS5KE4y7]{Sending}</em> to deliver an important message to someone the exact moment they need to hear it, or casting <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.0fYE64odlKqISzft]{Rusting Grasp}</em> to weaken a structure and cause some necessary calamity.</p>
