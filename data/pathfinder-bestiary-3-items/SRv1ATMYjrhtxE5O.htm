<hr />
<p>A lovelorn's presence instills unease and turns the air cold, dark, and stale. Creatures within the aura take a -1 circumstance penalty to saving throws made to resist emotion effects.</p>
<p>If the lovelorn makes a place home for a week or more, that location can become suffused with this magic even outside the lovelorn's aura, lasting until the lovelorn leaves or is destroyed.</p>
