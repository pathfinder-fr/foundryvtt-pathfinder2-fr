<hr />
<p>The gliminal emits bright light in the area, and dim light out to 60 feet. When a creature enters or starts its turn in the area of bright light, it must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:25] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} until the end of its turn.</p>
<p>If the mantle is counteracted or suppressed, the gliminal loses their resistance and can't use Bond in Light until the mantle returns.</p>
