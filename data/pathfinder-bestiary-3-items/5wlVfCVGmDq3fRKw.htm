<hr />
<p>The squirming swill reeks of food that is simultaneously burned and spoiled. A creature that enters or starts its turn in the emanation must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:17] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} (@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 2} on a critical failure). A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>
<p>When a creature succeeds at a Fortitude save to recover from this sickness, it regurgitates a chunk of food that immediately slithers away to join the swill, restoring [[/r 3]] Hit Points to the swill.</p>
