------ Description (en) ------
<p>The kodama spends 1 minute to fashion an enchanted straw rope out of nearby materials. The rope can be wrapped around other kami creatures to protect them from fell forces.</p>
<p>A kami who wears a <em>spiritual rope</em> gains resistance 5 to evil damage (though this is usually relevant only if the kami is good-aligned), a +1 status bonus to AC against evil creatures, and a +1 status bonus to saving throws against effects from evil creatures.</p>
<p>A kodama always wears a <em>spiritual rope</em>, and they can have one other <em>spiritual rope</em> in existence at a time. Creating a new rope beyond these two releases the magic of one other rope of the kodama's choosing. A <em>spiritual rope </em>around a creature other than a kodama loses its magic after 24 hours or if it's taken outside of the kodama's forest.</p>
