------ Description (en) ------
<p>A roiling incant is as much a mass of unstable magic as it is a creature. Is isn't living or undead, nor is it even a construct. It can't be healed or Repaired and is destroyed at 0 Hit Points, though it naturally recovers a number of Hit Points equal to its level × its Constitution modifier ([[/r 54]] for most roiling incants) each day.</p>
<p>Each time a roiling incant casts one of its non-cantrip spells, it drains its own magic to do so, taking [[/r {5}[force]]]{5 force damage}.</p>
