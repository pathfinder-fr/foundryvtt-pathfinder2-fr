------ Description (en) ------
<p>A creature hit by the mobogo's tongue becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} by the mobogo. The creature isn't immobilized, but it can't move beyond the reach of the mobogo's tongue.</p>
<p>A creature can sever the tongue with a Strike against AC 27 that deals at least 10 slashing damage. This deals no damage to the mobogo but prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes 1 round.</p>
<p>The mobogo can move without ending the Grab as long as the creature remains within the tongue's reach.</p>
