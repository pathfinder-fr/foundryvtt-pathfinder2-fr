<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The deimavigga whispers disturbing lies, audible only to the target, to shake the target's faith in the spell's caster. The target must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:43] save.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target disbelieves the lies and receives the intended benefit of the spell; the target becomes temporarily immune to Whispers of Discord for 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Failure</strong> The spell fails to affect the target. The target refuses all aid from that caster for 1 round and doesn't count as the caster's ally.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the duration is 1 minute.</p>
