Name: Eternal Fear
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>The kimenhul contorts its faces and presents itself to its enemies in a terrifying and traumatic display that causes lingering fear. Each creature within 100 feet that can observe the kimenhul must make a @Check[type:will|dc:42] save.</p>
<p>They are then temporarily immune for 10 minutes.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 3}.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 3} and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} as long as it's frightened. Even after recovering from the initial experience, the trauma is lodged in the target's mind for 1 year. Once per day, the kimenhul can communicate telepathically with the target for 1 minute as long as both creatures are on the same plane. Any time a creature under the effect of Eternal Fear is in a stressful situation (such as combat or intense social pressure), they must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:11] check or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2}. While Eternal Fear lasts, the target always becomes fleeing as long as it's frightened, regardless of the source of the fear. The target can attempt a new saving throw each week to remove these effects, but they can otherwise be removed only by powerful magic such as <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]{Wish}</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the effects are permanent and the target doesn't get to attempt a weekly save to end the effect.</p>
