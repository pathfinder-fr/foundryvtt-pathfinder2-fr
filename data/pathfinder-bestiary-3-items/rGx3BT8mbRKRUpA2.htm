<hr />
<p>A creature that begins its turn within the area feels its body begin to stretch and must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:33] save or become destabilized.</p>
<p>A destabilized creature emits a 10-foot destabilizing field aura and becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1}. The destabilization ends when the creature is no longer sickened.</p>
<p>A creature that succeeds at its saving throw against the aura is temporarily immune to all destabilizing fields for 1 minute.</p>
