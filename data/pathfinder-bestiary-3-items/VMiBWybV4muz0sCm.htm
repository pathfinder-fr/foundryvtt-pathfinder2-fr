------ Description (en) ------
<p>A hieracosphinx has an innate magical defense similar to a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.WG91Z5TiR6oO5FOw]{Contingency}</em>.</p>
<p>When they take a specific type of energy damage (varying by the individual sphinx), they can use their reaction to have the glyph cast <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.o6YCGx4lycsYpww4]{Haste}</em> on them. The glyph is then dormant for 1 week.</p>
<p>A critical success to Recall Knowledge about a particular hieracosphinx (30 or higher on the check) reveals which damage type triggers the glyph.</p>
