------ Description (en) ------
<p>The seething spirit attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same effect as a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.wU6hNzK8Yfqdmc8m]{Possession}</em> spell (DC 30), except since the spirit doesn't have a physical body, they're not unconscious and paralyzed when the effect ends. The spirit can't Dismiss the possession.</p>
<p>The creature gains [[/r 12]] temporary Hit Points that are lost when the possession ends. During the possession, the creature has the pulse of rage aura. Each time the possessed creature makes a melee Strike, the spirit can substitute their ephemeral claw attack modifier, damage amount, or both in place of the creature's own statistics.</p>
