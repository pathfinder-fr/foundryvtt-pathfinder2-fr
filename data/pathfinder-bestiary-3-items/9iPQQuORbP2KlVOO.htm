------ Description (en) ------
<p>The harmona beats their wings skyward, creating a spiraling vibration. Each creature in a @Template[type:cone|distance:30] must attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:30|traits:damaging-effect] save as the high-frequency blast flings them up and away.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is pushed 5 feet away and knocked off balance, becoming @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} until the start of their next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> Sonic waves fling the creature 15 feet back from the harmona. The creature takes [[/r {6d6}[bludgeoning]]]{6d6 bludgeoning damage} from the fall and lands @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone}.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature is flung 30 feet and takes double damage.</p>
