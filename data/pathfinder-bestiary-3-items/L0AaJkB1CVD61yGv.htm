------ Description (en) ------
<p>As a 3-action activity with the concentrate trait, a raktavarna's master can observe the world through the raktavarna's eyes, instead of their own. This uses the raktavarna's Perception and darkvision.</p>
<p>Each round, the master must spend a single action, which also has the concentrate trait, to maintain the connection. This ability functions at any range, even on different planes of existence.</p>
<p>If the raktavarna dies while their master is using this ability, the master is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 5}.</p>
