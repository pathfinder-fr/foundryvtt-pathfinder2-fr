------ Description (en) ------
<p>The baykok steals life from its victim and leaves listless dread in its place.</p>
<p>If a target fails its save against Devour Life, it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1}.</p>
<p>Each time the target gets a full night's rest, it must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:26] save or its drained value increases rather than decreasing. The curse ends if the creature recovers from the drained condition, but if the creature would reach drained 5 from this effect, it dies.</p>
