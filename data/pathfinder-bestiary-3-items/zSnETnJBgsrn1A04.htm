------ Description (en) ------
<p>The duende shrinks to the size of an ant, allowing them to enter very small tunnels within the earth such as anthills or termite mounds. Their Speed decreases to 5 feet. They can remain in this size until they end the effect by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait.</p>
<p>If the duende is underground and a creature hits the space they're occupying with a Strike (hitting automatically) that deals 5 damage or more, the duende is expelled from the tunnels, returns to their normal size, and takes bludgeoning damage equal to the damage from the Strike.</p>
