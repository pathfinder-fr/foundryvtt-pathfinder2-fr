------ Description (en) ------
<p>The nikaramsa focuses their gaze on one creature within 60 feet. That target must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:34] save. Regardless of the outcome of the saving throw, the target then becomes temporarily immune for 1 day.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The nikaramsa is caught off guard by the strength of the target's resistance and becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 2} until the end of their next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target resists the nikaramsa's influence.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target's focus and willpower drain away; it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 2} for 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 3} for 1 hour.</p>
