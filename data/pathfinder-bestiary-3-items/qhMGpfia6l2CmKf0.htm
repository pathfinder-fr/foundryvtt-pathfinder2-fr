------ Description (en) ------
<p>While a creature is taking persistent mental damage from the ioton, the ioton takes the shape of a creature familiar to the target, such as an acquaintance, pet, or common animal, though the appearance is imperfect and grants no benefit to Impersonate an individual.</p>
<p>While transformed, the ioton loses its incorporeal trait, immunities, and resistances, but it gains an unarmed melee Strike with a +6 attack modifier that deals [[/r {1d8+2}[bludgeoning]]]{1d8+2 bludgeoning damage}. The ioton immediately returns to its original form once no creature is taking persistent mental damage from it.</p>
