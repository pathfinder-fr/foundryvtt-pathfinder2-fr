------ Description (en) ------
<p>The first time each round a creature takes damage from the fossil golem's jaws, the target must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:32] save.</p>
<p>If it fails and has not already been slowed by this ability, it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} for 1 minute. If the creature was already slowed by this ability, a failed save causes it to be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dTwPJuKgBQCMxixg]{Petrified} permanently.</p>
