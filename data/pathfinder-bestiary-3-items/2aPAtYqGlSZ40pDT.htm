------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A foe Casts a Spell the maharaja knows, and the maharaja rakshasa can see its manifestation</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The maharaja expends one of their spell slots to reflect the triggering creature's spell. The maharaja loses their spell slot as if they had cast the triggering spell, and then attempts to counteract it (counteract modifier [[/r 1d20+37]], counteract level 10).</p>
<p>On a success, the maharaja turns the spell back on its caster. The reflected spell affects only the caster, even if it's an area spell or would normally affect more than one creature. The original caster can attempt a save and use other defenses against the reflected spell as normal.</p>
