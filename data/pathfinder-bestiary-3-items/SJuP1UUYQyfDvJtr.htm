------ Description (en) ------
<p>A lampad queen can inspire a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of their favor, typically a lock of their hair.

<p>If a lampad queen grants their Inspiration to a bard and they are that bard's muse, the bard gains an additional benefit depending on their muse theme: for lore muse, the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks; for maestro muse, the status bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the effects of compositions; for polymath muse, the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey.</p>
