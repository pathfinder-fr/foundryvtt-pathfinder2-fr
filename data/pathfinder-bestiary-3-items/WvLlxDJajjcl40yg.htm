------ Description (en) ------
<p>The kappa pulls one of their arms, gaining 10-foot reach with that arm. The opposing arm shrinks to little more than a hand extending from their shell. The kappa can still use their shortened hand to hold things, but they can't use that hand to wield a shield or weapon.</p>
<p>By spending a single action to pull their opposing arm, the kappa can return their arms to their original length.</p>
