------ Description (en) ------
<p>A lampad queen is intrinsically tied to a specific underground region, usually a cave system. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the lampad queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals that would harm the environment, such as <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.7yWXx3qC4eFNHhxD]{Blight}</em>, with a [[/r 1d20+30]] counteract modifier and a counteract level of 8.</p>
<p>When the lampad queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, their warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the lampad queen swiftly heals the entire region.</p>
