------ Description (en) ------
<p>The chyzaedu wears an eerie, alien layer of shimmering violet mucus that slithers and crawls over its flesh, but is hard as iron to the touch.</p>
<p>If a chyzaedu takes bludgeoning damage from a critical hit, its alien vestment is shattered—this reduces its AC to 27 and causes it to lose its resistance to mental and physical damage; it can grow a new alien vestment by concentrating for 1 hour.</p>
