<hr />
<p>This aura emanates from any creature possessed by the seething spirit, and it's inactive while the spirit isn't possessing anyone.</p>
<p>Any creature in the aura, including a creature possessed by the spirit, takes a -1 status penalty to AC, can't perform actions with the concentrate trait except for the Seek action and actions with the rage trait, and gains a +2 status bonus to melee damage rolls against the spirit's enemies.</p>
<p>A creature can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:30] save when it enters the aura to avoid the effect. If the creature would need to attempt a save against the aura again within 24 hours, it automatically uses the same save result rather than attempting a new save.</p>
