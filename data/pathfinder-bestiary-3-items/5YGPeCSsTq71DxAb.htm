------ Description (en) ------
<p>If the vilderavn kills a humanoid target with a critical hit using their Jaws Strike, they rip out and devour the target's heart and soul as part of the attack. While the target is dead, the vilderavn can Change Shape into the target's form, gaining a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to impersonate the target. If magic would resurrect the creature, the caster must succeed at a DC 34 counteract check to extract the target's soul from the vilderavn; otherwise, the spell fails.</p>
