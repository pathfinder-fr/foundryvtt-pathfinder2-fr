<p><strong>Effect</strong> The dragon chooses a mortal they've observed performing an exceptional act and offers their august blessing in exchange for the creature carrying out a specific directive, such as defeating a tyrant or protecting a sacred site.</p>
<p>If the creature agrees, until its next daily preparations, it gains a +2 status bonus to the dragon's choice of attack rolls, AC, or all of the following: Perception, Will saves, and Charisma-based skill checks.</p>
<p>The dragon can Dismiss this benefit by spending a single action (that has the concentrate trait), which they're swift to do if the mortal dares to defy the dragon's directive.</p>
