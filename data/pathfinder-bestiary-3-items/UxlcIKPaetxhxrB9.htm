<hr />
<p>A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the area must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:19] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} (plus @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} for as long as it's sickened on a critical failure).</p>
<p>While within the aura, affected creatures take a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to all globsters' stenches for 1 minute.</p>
