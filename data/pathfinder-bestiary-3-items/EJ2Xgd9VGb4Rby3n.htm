------ Description (en) ------
<p>The soul skelm makes a melee Strike trailing a wave of shadowy illusions. The skelm is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} until the start of his next turn. If the Strike is successful, the skelm increases the number of damage dice by one, and the target must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:29] save.</p>
<p>On a failure, the target becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible}, inaudible, and otherwise imperceptible to its allies for 4 rounds, and it likewise can't see, hear, or otherwise perceive those allies.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome, the creature is temporarily immune to Isolating Lash for 24 hours.</p>
