<p><strong>Effect</strong> The moon hag howls a series of dreadful, apocalyptic predictions at a single creature within 30 feet, shattering its perceptions of reality.</p>
<p>The target must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:29] save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 2} (@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 3} on a critical failure); regardless of the outcome, the creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours. A creature that can see the moon takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saving throws against Dreadful Prediction.</p>
<p>The stupefied condition from Dreadful Prediction persists until the curse is removed.</p>
