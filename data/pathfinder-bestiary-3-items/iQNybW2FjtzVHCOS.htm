------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a tidehawk dies, it melts into a torrent of rainwater. If this rain falls into a body of water, such as an ocean or lake, the tidehawk returns to life fully healed [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds} later, as if subject to a 6th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.kqhPt9344UkcGVYO]{Resurrect}</em> ritual. Self-resurrection happens only if there are remains to resurrect; for instance, a tidehawk killed by a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.r7ihOgKv19eJQnik]{Disintegrate}</em> spell can't use this ability. A tidehawk that dies while above land must wait until its rainwater runs or seeps into an appropriate body of water to self-resurrect. A tidehawk can self-resurrect only once per year.</p>
