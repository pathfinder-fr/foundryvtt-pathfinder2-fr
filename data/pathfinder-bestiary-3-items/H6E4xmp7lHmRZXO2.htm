------ Description (en) ------
<p>Creatures that fail their Will save against the titan's Impossible Stature aura also experience the crushing depths and darkness of the ocean floor.</p>
<p>Such creatures see as if in an area of <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.4GE2ZdODgIQtg51c]{Darkness}</em> (10th level), and the titan can use their wavesense to detect such creatures as a precise sense, even if neither are in water. On a critical failure, the creature is also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized}.</p>
