<hr />
<p>The churning water around the bone ship tinges red with seeping blood. A living creature that enters water in the aura sees visions of itself drowning in the blood and must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:37] save. After attempting this saving throw, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 hour.</p>
<p>On a failure, the creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2} (@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 4} on a critical failure) and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 1}, and it takes a -4 status penalty to Athletics checks to Swim.</p>
