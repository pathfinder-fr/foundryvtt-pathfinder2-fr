------ Description (en) ------
<p>A living creature struck by a globster's tendril must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:19] save. On a failure, the creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1}. If the creature is already sickened, the condition value increases by 1, to a maximum of sickened 4.</p>
<p>Once a creature succeeds at its saving throw, it is temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>
