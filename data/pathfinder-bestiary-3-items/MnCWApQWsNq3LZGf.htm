------ Description (en) ------
<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Trigger</strong> The hadrinnex takes damage of a physical or energy damage type (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing for physical; acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, or sonic for energy)</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The hadrinnex reconfigures its husk (if triggered by physical damage) or its energy gland (if triggered by energy damage). Any reconfiguration applies to the triggering damage and lasts until the next time the hadrinnex uses Rapid Evolution.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy Gland</strong> Reconfiguring the energy gland changes both the hadrinnex's energy damage resistance and the damage of its energy ray to that type. By default, the energy gland is configured to sonic.</li>
<li><strong>Husk</strong> The hadrinnex's physical damage resistance and the damage of its weapon arm Strikes change to the triggering type. Weapon arm Strikes gain an additional trait depending on the current damage type: bludgeoning adds shove, piercing adds deadly d8, and slashing adds sweep. By default the husk is configured to bludgeoning.</li>
</ul>
