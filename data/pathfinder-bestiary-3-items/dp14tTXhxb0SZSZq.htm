<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The swordkeeper has a central weapon</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The swordkeeper projects an echoblade—a force copy of its central weapon that deals [[/r {1d8}[force]]]{1d8 additional force damage} and gains thrown 30 feet. Echoblades inherit the weapon damage dice, weapon traits, and runes of the central weapon, but no other abilities or activations. The swordkeeper gains access to their critical specialization effects. The swordkeeper can have up to four echoblades at once; unattended echoblades vanish at the end of the swordkeeper's turn.</p>
