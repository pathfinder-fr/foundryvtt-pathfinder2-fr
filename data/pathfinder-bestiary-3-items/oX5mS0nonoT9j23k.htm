<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The blood painter has fresh blood applied to a claw using Dab</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The blood painter expends the blood on one claw to paint a illusion with the effects of one of the following spells: <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.f8SBoXiXQjlCKqly]{Illusory Creature}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.i35dpZFI7jZcRoBo]{Illusory Disguise}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.2oH5IufzdESuYxat]{Illusory Object}</em>, or <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.j8vIoIEWElvpwkcI]{Mirror Image}</em>.</p>
<p>The Paint action gains the traits of the spell it's reproducing, and the blood painter can Sustain a Spell on these effects. They use a spell attack modifier of +20 and DC 28 for these effects, which are heightened to 5th level.</p>
<p>If they have fresh blood applied to two or more claws, the blood painter can expend the blood on all of them to instead produce the effects of <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.TCk2MDwf5L5OYjFC]{Cloak of Colors}</em> or <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.RQjSQVZRG497cJhX]{Vibrant Pattern}</em>.</p>
<p>Any effects produced by this ability have a +2 status bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and AC against the creature whose blood was used to Paint and that creature takes a -2 status penalty to Perception checks and saves against it.</p>
