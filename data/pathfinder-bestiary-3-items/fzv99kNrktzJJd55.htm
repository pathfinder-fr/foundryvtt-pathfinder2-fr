Name: Overpowering Healing
Nom: 
Ã‰tat: aucune

------ Description (en) ------
<p>When a gliminal grants positive healing that would heal a living creature above their maximum Hit Points, including the fast healing HP from their Bond in Light ability, the excess is granted as temporary Hit Points.</p>
<p>Unlike normal, these temporary HP combine with each other, and they last for 1 hour. If a creature's temporary HP from a gliminal ever exceeds its maximum HP, it becomes overloaded and explodes in a burst of positive energy.</p>
<p>A creature with temporary HP from overpowering healing becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1}, or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 2} if the temporary HP equal half their maximum HP or more. The creature can't reduce this sickened condition unless it has 0 temporary HP.</p>
<p>Overpowering healing doesn't apply to creatures with the positive trait.</p>
