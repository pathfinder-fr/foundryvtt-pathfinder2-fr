<hr />
<p>A chyzaedu gains sustenance by feeding upon the metabolisms of organic victims. A living creature that ends its turn in the aura must attempt a Will save.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature suffers a painful hunger pang, becoming @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} for 1 round.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> If possible, the creature spends its first 2 actions on its next turn eating or drinking (or spending actions to procure food or drink from its possessions or the surroundings, if necessary). The creature won't consume anything dangerous, but will eat things it normally has no appetite for.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature will eat or drink dangerous consumables, such as poison or rotten food, if other food or drink are not immediately available. The creature must spend its first 2 actions each round consuming for as long as it remains in the chyzaedu's aura plus 1 minute thereafter, but the creature can attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn each round to end the effect early.</p>
