------ Description (en) ------
<p>The millindemalion quickly crafts a mind-altering hat in combat and tosses it onto a target with a flick of their wrist. The millindemalion chooses one of the effects below and makes a ranged attack roll with a [[/r 1d20+27]] modifier and a range increment of 20 feet.</p>
<p>On a hit, the target must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:33] saving throw or experience the listed effect for [[/br 1d4+1 #rounds]]{1d4+1 rounds}. If the millindemalion critically succeeds at the ranged Strike, the target takes a -4 circumstance penalty on the save.</p>
<p>A target can only wear one millindemalion hat at a time; a new hat replaces any previous hat. The hat can't be removed before the condition ends, but when the condition ends (or on a successful save), the hat falls to pieces.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Befuddling Bowler</strong> The hat clouds the target's mind; the target becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 2}.</li>
<li><strong>Bewitching Beret</strong> The target is infatuated with their new hat and its creator, becoming @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AdPVz7rbaVSRxHFg]{Fascinated} by the millindemalion and the beret.</li>
<li><strong>Dazzling Deerstalker</strong> The target can barely see with the hat falling down over its eyes and gains the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} condition.</li>
<li><strong>Fettering Fedora</strong> The target feels a heavy weight pressing down on them from the hat and takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to their Speeds.</li>
<li><strong>Tiring Tricorne</strong> The target grows sleepy and becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}.</li>
</ul>
