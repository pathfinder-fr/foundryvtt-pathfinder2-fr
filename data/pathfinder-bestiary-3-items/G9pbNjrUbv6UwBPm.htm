------ Description (en) ------
<p>Over the course of 1 hour, the quintessivore removes and deconstructs the soul of a creature. The creature must either be captive or have been dead for no more than 2 hours before the start of the process. At the end of the hour, the quintessivore consumes the quintessence of the creature's soul.</p>
<p>For the next month, it gains a +1 status bonus to its spell DC and spell attack roll, and it adds 6th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.5BbU1V6wGSGbrmRD]{Feeblemind}</em> and <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.fd31tAHSSGXyOxW6]{Vampiric Exsanguination}</em> to its arcane prepared spells.</p>
<p>Deconstructing a soul maps the unique properties of the creature's soul into the quintessivore's blade-legs. The soul can be reconstructed by binding it to quintessence. A dead quintessivore's soul flees its body as pure quintessence suitable for this purpose.</p>
