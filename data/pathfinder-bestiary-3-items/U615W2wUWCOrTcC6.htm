------ Description (en) ------
<p><strong>Trigger</strong> The adachros takes 25 or more bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Effect</strong> The attack breaks off part of the adachros's body. This fragment reshapes and animates into an @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-3.FXwgsLTRneGzclsw]{Ioton} with the minion trait under the adachros's control. The ioton sycophant can't move more than 120 feet from the adachros and crumbles after 1 minute.</p>
<p>If the adachros gives it no other commands, the ioton sycophant spends its turn praising the adachros and affirming the adachros's infallibility; this grants the adachros [[/r 4d6]] temporary Hit Points that last for as long as the ioton sycophant exists, and a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round.</p>
