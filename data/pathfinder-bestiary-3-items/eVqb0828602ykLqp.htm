------ Description (en) ------
<p>The depression atop a kappa's head is filled with water. Spilling, evaporating, or otherwise removing all of the water from the top of a kappa's head reduces all their Speeds to 5 feet until the basin is again filled with water.</p>
<p>A kappa who becomes prone must succeed at a @Check[type:reflex|dc:15] save or spill their water, and a kappa who becomes unconscious automatically spills their water.</p>
<p>If a kappa is grappled, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.VcDeM8A5oI6VqhbM]{Restrained}, or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned}, another creature can attempt to spill the water from their bowl by spending a single action, which has the attack and manipulate traits, to attempt an Athletics check against the kappa's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature spills the kappa's water.</p>
