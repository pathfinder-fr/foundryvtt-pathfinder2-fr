<p>When your shark senses blood, it tears into your enemies. Until the start of your next turn, each time you hit a creature in the shark's reach with a Strike and deal slashing or piercing damage, the creature takes [[/r 1d8 # slashing damage]]{1d8 slashing damage} from the shark. If your shark is nimble or savage, the slashing damage increases to [[/r 2d8 # slashing damage]]{2d8}.</p>
