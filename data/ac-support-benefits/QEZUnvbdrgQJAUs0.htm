------ Description (en) ------
<p>The vulture retches and vomits onto a foe within 10 feet. Until the start of your next turn, if you hit and deal damage to the target, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Sickened]{Sickened 1} (@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Sickened]{Sickened 2} on a critical failure). The DC of the Fortitude save is 12 (or 14, if the vulture is a specialized animal companion) + your level + the vulture's Constitution modifier.</p>
