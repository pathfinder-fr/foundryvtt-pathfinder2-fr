------ Description (en) ------
<p>The zombie emits an aura of rot, causing wounds to fester. Until the start of your next turn, each time you hit a creature that's within 10 feet of the zombie and you deal damage, the creature takes an additional [[/r 1d6]] damage as the wound festers. If your zombie is nimble or savage, the damage increases to [[/r 2d6]]. This is a disease and necromancy effect.</p>
