------ Description (en) ------
<p>You've powered up your construct's weaponry. Choose one of your construct's unarmed attacks to gain your choice of one initial weapon modification, chosen from the list on page 18 or from other initial weapon modifications to which you have access. The unarmed attack must meet any requirements for the chosen traits (such as being a melee attack for entangling form), and since it's an unarmed attack, it can never meet certain requirements, such as being a simple weapon for complex simplicity.</p>
<p><em>Note: Weapon Modifications are not in this module or the system currently, the strike rule elements on the appropriate feature can be modified to apply the modifications.</em></p>
